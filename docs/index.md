# GameMaker Release Notes

<br/>

## {% include inline_image.html file="monthly.jpg" max-width="26" margin-bottom="-6" %} Monthly

Released _roughly_ every other month up until the end of 2024, much slower since then. Always intended to be stable, but may have the odd lower-severity issue.

## {% include inline_image.html file="lts.jpg" max-width="26" margin-bottom="-6" %} LTS

Long Term Stable means very few new features are ever added and it only gets critical bug fixes each time there is an update (which is very infrequent).

#### [2022.0.3](\release-notes\2022\0) - November 2024

<br/>

## {% include inline_image.html file="beta.jpg" max-width="26" margin-bottom="-6" %} Beta

Most up-to-date version and released very frequently, so you can get the newest features and fixes ASAP - but accordingly these releases _will_ contain bugs, so please do report any you find!

We only recommend using the latest series of Betas (shown below) - if you need to stay on older Betas for some reason, then we would suggest just using the applicable Monthly instead of your Beta install.

#### [2024.1400.1](\release-notes\2024\1400_1) - Nov 2025 onwards

<br/>

## GMRT

New runtimes currently in development, which will eventually replace all the "GMS2" targets you can see in the GameMaker IDE - but accordingly these releases _will_ contain bugs and may not support functionality you're using in your projects, so it's **essential** you read the release notes and all setup information before deciding if you want to take part in the GMRT beta and feedback process.

Always use the latest version of GMRT (shown below) in conjunction with the latest Beta release (see above), as you should always have the newest fixes/changes before filing any issues.

#### [0.18](\release-notes\2025\GMRT_ms_18) - October 2025
