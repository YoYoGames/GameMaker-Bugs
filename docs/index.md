# GameMaker Release Notes

<br/>

## {% include inline_image.html file="monthly.jpg" max-width="26" margin-bottom="-6" %} Monthly

Released _roughly_ every other month. Fairly stable, but may have the odd lower-severity issue.

<br/>

## {% include inline_image.html file="lts.jpg" max-width="26" margin-bottom="-6" %} LTS

Long Term Stable means very few new features are ever added and it only gets critical bug fixes each time there is an (infrequent) update.

### [2022.0.2 - LTS](\release-notes\2022\0)

<br/>

## {% include inline_image.html file="beta.jpg" max-width="26" margin-bottom="-6" %} Beta

Most up-to-date version and released frequently, so you can get the newest features and fixes ASAP - but accordingly these releases _will_ contain bugs, so please do report any you find!

We only recommend using the latest series of Betas (shown below) - if you need to stay on older Betas for some reason, then we would suggest just using the applicable Monthly instead.

### [2024.600 - June](\release-notes\2024\600)
