## {% include inline_image.html file="lts.jpg" max-width="26" margin-bottom="-6" %} LTS

Long Term Stable means very few new features are ever added and it only gets critical bug fixes each time there is an (infrequent) update.

### [2022.0.2.51 - LTS](\release-notes\2022\0)

<br/>

## {% include inline_image.html file="beta.jpg" max-width="26" margin-bottom="-6" %} Beta

Most up-to-date version and released frequently, so you can get the newest features and fixes ASAP - but accordingly these releases _will_ contain bugs, so please do report any you find!
