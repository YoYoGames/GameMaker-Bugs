# 2022.0.2 - Current Version: IDE 51/Runtime 49

Downloads: [Windows](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2022.0.2.51.exe) - [macOS](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-2022.0.2.51.pkg)

Always check your SDKs and other external tools are the correct versions before doing any builds, as you can see from the release notes below that several platforms have been updated for this release - you can see our [Required SDKs For LTS FAQ](https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us/articles/7387539695645) and the various platform setup guides that page links to in order to get all of this information at any time.

_And remember, if a fix/feature you need is not listed in these notes, then please continue using the regular monthly release, as LTS releases by their very nature are not intended to contain everything found in newer GameMaker versions._

# Changes In The .3 Update (Sept, 2024)

This is a pre-release at the moment, so if you would like to get the installer and take part in the feedback session for this version, please see the [2022.0.3 LTS "Early Look" Thread](https://forum.gamemaker.io/index.php?threads/2022-0-3-lts-early-look-thread.115055/)


## IDE Featured Changes

- **Support For Opening Projects Made In Newer IDEs**
    - This release has the ability to open projects which have come from IDEs right up to and including 2024.8.1 (assuming the _contents_ of the project are all supported within LTS releases, obviously)
    - Be aware that if you want to move between 2024.8 and LTS, but for some reason you also still need to use an older LTS runtime with the LTS .3 IDE, then you will not be able to build a project which was exported by 2024.8.0 specifically - you must use 2024.8.1 to export the project into LTS22 format

- **New Release Notes Site**
    - The two legacy release notes pages on the Help menu inside GameMaker have been replaced by a link to this site you're reading at the moment - [releases.gamemaker.io](https://releases.gamemaker.io/), which is the home for all release notes going forward and also gives some handy links to our most important or often-required support guides
    - As you can see, this site gives info on the current Monthly/LTS/Beta releases and a number of older Monthly/LTS releases since the old release notes page stopped being updated (including download links for the installers)
    - If you just want to quickly see what's already planned for upcoming (Open) releases or went into existing (Closed) releases, you can do this on the ["all Milestones" list page](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date)

- **New Manual Site**
    - All manual links have been changed to directly open the newer-style "gamemaker.io" URLs that the website will have been silently redirecting you to for a while
    - You can see that page addresses are in the format "manual.gamemaker.io/lts/LANGUAGE/", where the language is the standard two-character code for your language and so you can quickly edit your address bar and go between the supported localisations

- **"Contact-Us Package" Tool Upgraded To Upload Your Files Privately**
    - Also, LTS users now have the _Help > Upload a Bug/Ticket Sample_ tool [#6375](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6375)
    - This tool grabs all your log files automatically and turns them into a .zip file, allows you to add an example project and any additional files you want to include and then, crucially, it will **privately** upload the .zip to our server for you
    - You are then returned a URL (there's a clickable button to copy this to your OS clipboard) and you can add that URL onto any existing GitHub bug report or customer service ticket, safe in the knowledge that only GameMaker staff can access that upload (you can't even download it yourself)
    - This means you can now very easily add missing samples onto bug reports whenever we request a project, or send logs and other information in support of _other user's_ bug reports to show you have the same problem, etc. - you no longer need to report a duplicate copy of any bug report just to privately send us additional files!
    - {% include note.html content="If you're someone who prefers using the GitHub website forms for creating bug reports, rather than the IDE, then we would strongly recommend using this tool for all files you wish to link to on the bug report, rather than using any external fire-sharing host or attaching files publicly on the bug form" %}

- **Project Loading/Importing - Support For Opening More Projects Edited In Newer Releases**
    - Added support for the separated options change put into the main project .yyp file in more recent release, so now more projects will open not in read-only mode
    - However, note that projects which have been edited in newer Monthly/Beta releases may well be using newer functionality than this LTS supports and so you will still see these open read-only or be told GameMaker could not open them

- **Report A GameMaker Bug" Tool**
    - As of this release you can now use the in-IDE bug-reporting tool that has been available in monthlies for a little while
    - For more information on how and when to use the new reporter (and when not to!), or what your report will contain and what we will use it for, please see https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us/articles/13150754375453-Submitting-a-Bug-Report-What-Does-It-Contain
    - Crash reports now use this newer bug-reporter system, rather than the old dialog you may have seen in the past
    - And automated crash reports (ones where GameMaker asks you to send us a report shortly after starting up) include some recent “.gz” ui.log archives in with bug reports and then cleans all of these archive files out from GM's settings folder [#5935](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5935)
    - And there is a link for how/where to report security issues [#5567](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5567)
    - _A polite reminder to **always** read the release notes and then also search the bug database (or at the very least check the 3 pinned issues at the top of the page) before you send any reports!_
    - _And if you use **Steam** to run GameMaker, remember that there are additional important release notes on the Steam store page for your GameMaker install each time a new version is released._
    - {% include note.html content="Bear in mind that as an LTS user you're also potentially a long way behind the current monthly release and you do not need to report duplicate issues for things we have already fixed, so it's even more important that you search for existing issues and you confirm that the bug still happens in the current monthly release before sending us any bug reports, please!" %}

- **Other Bugs Fixed**
    - Docs Integration: The Mac IDE no longer opens the Monthly manual instead of the LTS manual (the Windows IDE was correct already) [#7617](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7617)
    - Docs Integration: Help > "Knowledge Base" in LTSr3 no longer opens the old URL for the help website
    - Game Options: [iOS, tvOS, macOS] "Build Number" field found in newer GM releases has now been added to LTS also [#7431](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7431)
    - Install: Nov 23 EULA has been added
    - Install: tvOS runtime installation no longer causes occasional silent crashes when installing newly-downloaded runtimes [#2077](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2077)
    - Sprite Editor: Fixed that GM went unstable when moving multiple frames at once in the preview bar [#7041](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7041)
    - Stability: GameMaker no longer has an intermittent fatal crash with audio threads [#2394](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2394)
    - Sequence Editor: GM no longer goes unstable when adding an asset track to a clipping mask in the Track Panel
    - Start Page: "Last Login" text in LTS IDEs is now correct and no longer says "Currently Offline" always [#7275](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7275)


## Runtime Featured Changes

- **Android - Support For Newer Build Tools**
    - Added support for building with API 34 [#7002](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7002)
    - For that one, you will need to update Android Studio manually yourself in order to get the API version if you do not have it already
    - Added support for building projects on Android to use Gradle version v8.7/plugin version 8.5, as API 34 requests [#5906](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5906)
    - For that one, the Android build tools should automatically download the new Gradle tools during your first build process inside GameMaker, but please do pay attention to the whole of your compiler log if you find you have issues building in this new version
    - (Especially if you know your machine is offline or that you typically firewall GameMaker, or you use any antivirus software, as you may need to temporarily remove those restrictions on your machine and allow the Android tools to update themselves)

- **Consoles - Support For Newer SDK Versions**
    - Be aware that all consoles are now updated to target the current SDK/Visual Studio/etc., versions as of 2024.8
    - Please see the Required SDKs FAQ link over to the left of this page or up at the very top of these notes, as you will need to ensure that you're on the correct versions externally and that your Preferences inside GameMaker have been fixed to match your install locations otherwise all builds will fail!
    - It's also worth cleaning your compiler cache inside GameMaker if you see any issues with builds

- **Consoles - Lots Of Other In-Game And Submission Fixes** 
    - Unfortunately, we're not allowed to individually list them all publicly here, but be aware that there are a _large_ number of console fixes included as part of this LTS update
    - (A lot more things are fixed for console platforms than for any others, so the true fixes list is much larger than the headlines shown below)
    - Please do test all games thoroughly after updating to this new release

- **game_change() Fixes/Improvements**
    - Improved transitions between games on all supported platforms
    - [macOS] Also improved the performance/reduced the time required to change between games
    - [Switch] Now passes launch parameters on to the launched game

- **iOS/macOS/tvOS - Support For Newer Xcode Versions**
    - Much like Android above, this lTS release brings support for the current Xcode versions required for AppStore submissions and for notarisation uploads
    - If you do not already have a current Xcode version installed you may need to update your Xcode install and also clean your project cache inside GameMaker before you will be able to do any builds in this release

- **Other Bugs Fixed**
    - Building Projects: [YYC] Compiles no longer fail if using an array item as the default value for a function argument [#7171](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7171)
    - Building Projects: [iOS] Xcode projects now target C++ version 17
    - Building Projects: [iOS] Archive version number no longer overrides the build number set inside Game options [#5676](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5676)
    - Building Projects: [Android] Google Play Asset Delivery now exports dynamic texture pages correctly, stopping a "black overlay in-game" problem [#2171](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2171)
    - In-Game: Assigning a variable a built-in value (x, y, health, score etc) in the Create event no longer causes errors when attempting to use the variable later
    - In-Game: Fixed a crash when accessing named instances in rooms created before GM v2.3.0
    - In-Game: [GX.games] .ogg files are now packaged correctly if they are in a subdirectory inside Included Files [#7162](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7162)
    - In-Game: [HTML5] HTTP Async event is no longer broken [#4925](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4925)
    - In-Game: [iOS] Mouse\touch returned values are no longer incorrect
    - In-Game: [macOS] audio_create_stream() sounds no longer crash the game [#5876](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5876)
    - In-Game: audio_get_recorder_count() now includes any devices which contain non-Latin characters in their name [#5124](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5124)
    - In-Game: collision_rectangle() now works correctly with precise collisions [#6179](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6179)
    - In-Game: network_send_broadcast() packets now come from the port expected for the specified socket [#2480](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2480)
    - In-Game: [HTML5] sprite_delete() no longer causes a crash [#7177](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7177)

# Changes In The .2 Update  (Oct 13, 2023)

## IDE Featured Changes

- **LTS Manuals**
    - In the last couple of LTS releases the IDEs always pointed at a fixed copy of the 2022.9 manual website when using the “online” manual Preference and downloaded the currently Monthly release’s manual when using the “offline” manual Preference
    - Now, you will find the offline and online manual both point at LTS-specific content (and that content has been updated for this release), so you won’t be told about things only available in newer Monthly releases, etc.
    - It’s important that if you’re using the LTS version, then you do ensure you’re looking at the LTS manual and also any LTS-specific versions of our Helpdesk setup guides which you require, as there are now significant differences compared with the Monthly releases

- **Game Options Additions**
    - [Android] Permission for LEANBACK_LAUNCHER is now optional, as Google Play no longer allows .apk submissions when this is enabled, and so there is a new Game Option for controlling whether you want this permission added or not
    - [Android] Also added a checkbox for setting the "android:allowBackup" application tag on/off
    - [GX.games] Previously, once a project had been uploaded to the store you could not change Game Options to have a different ID - you can now do this
    - [Switch] Added new checkboxes for whether your game will use NEX or NPLN [see the runtime notes for more info on the new NPLN support]
    - [Xbox GDK] Added more "Support 4K on ..." options to cover Xbox One X/S and Series X/S devices

- **”Move And Collide” Styling Changes**
    - Updated to the newer icon for this node (as used in monthlies for a little while), so now LTS is consistent and tutorials, etc., will be easier to follow
    - Also fixed the spacing between the fields in the layout and that the Tab indexes were wrong for some of the fields

- **Performance Boosts**
    - Added a new Preference in the Text Editor section for "Disable Right-To-Left Text Ordering" - this functionality has always been supported and was previously enabled for everyone, but was determined (after LTSr1) to be quite performance-heavy and so is now off by default, which means those who want right-to-left text anywhere in the IDE will need to toggle this setting to ON again
    - Improved the speed of the Asset Compiler phase of building your projects, so you will find your builds now take a little less time than before (exact results will vary per-project)

- **Misc Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Building Projects: Extension code injection now uses the correct content for all configurations in the project, rather than only even using the content from the Default config - _if your extensions are giving different results now and you’re using configs, ensure you are using the injection values you expected_
    - Project Save: Fixed that when duplicating a room the newly-created room still linked to the old room's creation code file until whenever you next opened the new room’s code window - _note that this will not automatically retroactively fix any projects already in this state!_

- **Other Bugs Fixed**
    - Building Projects: [Android YYC] NDK tools cannot handle the Temp directory name containing spaces, so added a warning dialog into Preferences for this if you supply a path which has an invalid space
    - Building Projects: [HTML5] Clicking the 'Stop' button to end a running project no longer displays 'FAILED: Run Program Complete' in the Output window
    - Building Projects: [HTML5] The output file no longer has to be named "index.html" in Game Options, otherwise the build fails - now it’s back to being customisable again
    - Building Projects: [PS4 and PS5] Builds no longer always use the debug runner path, regardless of its Preferences checkbox status
    - Building Projects: [Switch] Builds no longer always check the NEX installation path set in Preferences and cause a fail if a valid installation is not found - this check has been removed now because this is a valid setup, as you might only be supporting NLPN
    - Image Editor: Keyboard shortcuts no longer stop working after a Ctrl+Z operation [fixes "No valid action matches the id provided" errors in the ui.log that you may have seen in earlier releases if you ever had this issue]
    - Included Files: GM no longer freezes when adding 7k files at once into the datafiles folder
    - Localisation: [IT] Italian translation for "Clean" button now correct
    - Search and Replace: "Replace All" no longer ignores the "Ignore Comments" option
    - Preferences: [Xbox GDK] Visual Studio location in Platform Settings file-picker needs to allow "VSDevCmd.bat" as a filter also
    - UI/UX: Game Options button for “Xbox GDK Service Manifest for Event-Based Stats” no longer gives a broken error message or opens the wrong Preferences section when it asks you to fix your settings
    - For those of you who have already been using the new features mentioned higher up this page in the Monthly releases, then be aware that in most cases any subsequent bug fixes for those features which have been documented in later release notes have been added to this release also, but are not listed above as they did not apply to LTS 2022.0.1


## Runtime Featured Changes

- **iOS - Fixes For Xcode 15 Support**
    - A few fixes have been made to the Xcode project GameMaker generates for you when building your projects (typically when the project contains Cocoapods in your extensions) - this stops a couple of issues where Xcode would fail its part of the build until you changed a few checkbox values inside Xcode and tried again
    - There is nothing you need do now, but <i>should</i> you need to use an older runtime for some reason in future and you have updated to Xcode 15, then for more info on what you would need to change in Xcode yourself each build, see [#1770](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/1770) and [#1771](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/1771)

- **iOS/macOS/tvOS - Changes To Cocoapods Initialisation**
    - Changed the initialisation flow when building projects which use Cocoapods in your extensions to make the process simpler and much more automated
    - Will also detect and workaround/fix more setup issues present on the Mac itself, so GameMaker can install pods support for you
    - Also adds architecture support for both Intel and Silicon (M-series) Macs

- **macOS VM - Fix for "Malware" notifications the OS might have previously shown you after some macOS updates**
    - Recent OS updates (mostly in Ventura) started showing prompts suggesting the YoYoRunner.app package in some newer monthly releases was unsafe, so just to confirm: this release has the same fix
    - Please note that if you have already been seeing any permissions/OS errors on startup, then even after updating to this new version you might need to review [our permissions FAQ](https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us/articles/360022953052) in order to fix the additional issues you were already getting

-  **Console SDK Support Updates**
    - {% include important.html content="For all of the below, you will need to update your SDK installation to this version and potentially edit your Preferences paths to match, otherwise builds _will_ fail" %}
    - Switch - Support for SDK 16.2.4
    - PlayStation 4 - Support For SDK 11.000
    - PlayStation 5 - Support For SDK 8.000
    - Xbox - Support For GDK June 2023 Update 2 (230602)

- **Extensions - "remote_build_step" Support**
    - There is now another step available for extension developers/users, which is for a script which is ran on the remote machine so it can perform steps locally during the build process
    - For example, using the Windows IDE to build an iOS project, your extension could use this functionality to have the Mac which is doing the build gather files together and ensure they are brought into the package

- **Extensions - Misc Additions**
    - An extension's version can now be exported to both the runner (and recalled using <code>extension_get_version())</code> and can be checked in batch scripts using the environment variable `GMEXT_<ExtensionName>_Version`
    - Android (Java) and iOS (Obj-C) extensions now allow access to buffers using `BufferID`

- **Android - FPS Changes for 90/120hz screens**
    - Fixed most cases where "FPS" values do not reliably reach 90/120 when <code>game_set_speed()</code> requests these speeds
    - {% include note.html content="These changes are consistent with 2023.8.1’s contents and so we are aware some specific models of phones continue to override 120hz requests and revert the screen back down to 60 after a short delay" %}

- **Switch - Support For Larger Save Areas**
    - Functions have now been added for expanding a player's save data area size dynamically, so your game can create more save space when required:
    - `switch_save_data_get_max_size()` gets the maximum allowable save data area and save data journal area size from the NMETA file
    - `switch_save_data_get_size(account_id)` gets the save data area and save data journal area size for the user
    - `switch_save_data_set_size(account_id,save_data_size,save_data_journal_size)` extends the save data area for a user - the save data must not be mounted at the time and this function can only be called a limited number of times (32), so use sparingly

- **Switch - NPLN support**
    - Note that there are new Game Option checkboxes for toggling whether you want NEX or NPLN, so you will need to use that first if you want to enable this functionality
    - Also added an async event to indicate NPLN authentication status (this isn't necessary to wait for in all cases, as the NPLN functions will wait for authentication to complete before they do their own thing and will also report any failures, but it is needed for cases where the game wants to know the player's own NPLN user ID)
    - `switch_matchmaking_session_close_participation(userindex,sessionid)` - This function is used to close a matchmaking session to new participants, so if you don't support join in progress, you can close off the session after progressing from the lobby
    - `switch_matchmaking_session_open_participation(userindex,sessionid)` - This function is used to open a matchmaking session to new participants, so if you have previously closed off new participants from joining you can open it again with this call
    - `switch_matchmaking_session_autojoin(userindex,gamemode,jointype,minparticipants,maxparticipants,description,use_mesh_topology)`
    - `switch_npln_leaderboard_delete_score(npln_user_context,category_type_name,category_id)` - Deletes the score registered on the leaderboard
    - `switch_npln_leaderboard_get_scores_near(npln_user_context,category_type_name,category_id,category_season,request_size)` - Retrieve scores from a leaderboard, centered on the signed-in user
    - `switch_npln_leaderboard_get_scores_range(npln_user_context,category_type_name,category_id,category_season,request_offset,request_size)` - Retrieve scores from a leaderboard
    - `switch_npln_leaderboard_get_user_data(npln_user_context)` - Fetch the display name and optional data previously stored with `switch_npln_leaderboard_set_user_data()`
    - `switch_npln_leaderboard_set_score(npln_user_context,category_type_name,category_id,score,[score_data])` - Submit a score to a leaderboard
    - `switch_npln_leaderboard_set_user_data(npln_user_context,user_name,[user_data])` - Associate a display name and optional data with a player’s scores
    - `switch_npln_login_prearranged_user(user_index,npln_user_index,tenant_id_source)` - This function is used to login/create a "prearranged" NPLN user. This must be performed before any other NPLN functions are called - and prior to calling `switch_npln_login_prearranged_user()` you must first have called `switch_accounts_login_user()` for the given `user_index` to ensure the user is logged into their online account. (See the Nintendo reference documentation for more information on NPLN accounts.)
    - `switch_npln_session_create(npln_user_context, config_name, [options])`
    - `switch_npln_session_join(npln_user_context, session_id, [options])`
    - `switch_npln_session_join_alias(npln_user_context, session_alias, [options])`
    - `switch_npln_session_find(npln_user_context, config_name, [options])`
    - `switch_npln_session_matchmake(npln_user_context, config_name, [options])`
    - `switch_npln_session_destroy(npln_session_context)`
    - `switch_npln_session_create_alias(npln_session_context)`
    - `switch_npln_session_send_data(npln_session_context, user_session_id, buffer)`
    - `switch_npln_session_update(npln_handle, {session_data, enable_participation})`
    - Also added a new function for NEX matchmaking to mirror the new NLPN description function <code>switch_matchmaking_session_update_description(user_index, session_id, new_description)</code> for NEX games

- **Xbox GDK - Video PlayBack Changes**
    - Video playback on Xbox has always worked slightly differently to the other consoles. On Xbox videos were always drawn to fill the currently-set surface, whereas on the other consoles a new surface is created, which the video is decoded to, and it's then the game's responsibility to draw that surface to wherever it's required to be displayed
    - This release changes how Xbox works, so that it matches the other platforms
    - {% include important.html content="Accordingly, any code you have for video playback on Xbox will need to be reviewed now" %}

- **Xbox GDK - Now Able To Load UWP Game Saves**
    - `xboxone_set_savedata_uwp_compatibility()` enables compatibility with existing UWP save game files - this function must be called before the game performs any savedata-related file operations
    - {% include note.html content="This function is only to be used in projects which are updating an already-released UWP title to now use GDK instead" %}

- **Misc Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Building Projects: [Mac IDE] GX.games YYC build fails due to an Emscripten SDK issue supporting M-series Macs is now treated as an error, which stops builds incorrectly carrying on and looking like an in-game error  (If you're using an M1/M2 Mac, then be aware our setup guide has been changed to say you need to use Emscripten SDK v3.1.10 rather than 3.1.9)
    - Building Projects: You are now allowed to pass non-constant values into parent constructors, when previously this would have been a compilation error
    - Building Projects: AssetCompiler now gives a proper error if a function called by `Catch<` does not exist, rather than silently exiting
    - Building Projects: Added a proper error for when builds failing due to using the DS Grid # accessor with either the wrong number of arguments or the wrong type of DS
    - In-Game: Sub-pixel collisions are now consistent with the manual in that precisely 0.50 is now treated as a collision occurred
    - In-Game: HTTP error responses are no longer ignored when initiating WebSocket connections
    - In-Game: `audio_play_sound_ext()` no longer allows negative values for gain, pitch and offset
    - In-Game: `ds_list_replace()` now gives an error when attempting to replace a non-existent entry
    - In-Game: Fonts added via `font_add_sprite()` and `font_add_sprite_ext()` now respect their origin when drawn
    - In-Game: Spine `skeleton_...()` functions could previously be called on non-instance structs, which differed from other sprite structs (such as sprite_index) and also returned incorrect results, so now it gives a code error instead (the same as sprite_index has always done)
    - In-Game: [HTML5] `surface_create()` with negative or 0 size now throws an error to inform you the code was always wrong, rather than allowing the game to crash later on with no indication why
    - In-Game: [HTML5] `surface_reset_target()` multiple times without setting a target now throws an error to inform you the code was always wrong, rather than allowing the game to crash later on with no indication why
    - In-Game: `switch_irsensor_moment_config_set_preprocess_intensity_threshold()` function name being so long caused a crash in previous releases because the function could not be found   (this was actually any function with a name which is longer than 63 characters, so be aware if you use very long names for your own functions, as they would not be found in older runtimes)

- **Other Bugs Fixed**
    - Building Projects: Calling "new Constructor()" no longer requires an assignment and errors if one is missing, as this has been made a warning instead
    - Building Projects: extension/YYRunnerInterface.h is no longer missing a "return" keyword which prevented it from working correctly for some extensions
    - Building Projects: gml_pragma("PNGCrush"); now works properly again, as the crushed image is now added to the package, rather than the original being mistakenly added   (note that the texture page itself does need to use .png format in order for this command to work)
    - Building Projects: post_texture scripts are now run when targeting all valid platforms, not just Windows
    - Building Projects: [YYC] AssetCompiler crashes when building a game with Included Files or Extensions and the project path is shorter than the output path
    - Building Projects: [YYC] Using a Data Structure accessor with an index from a struct no longer causes builds to fail
