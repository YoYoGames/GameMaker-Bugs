# 2024.1100 - Current Version: IDE 713/Runtime 726 

Download Links: [Windows](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2024.1100.0.713.exe) - [macOS](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-2024.1100.0.713.pkg) - [Ubuntu Beta](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Beta-2024.1100.0.713.deb)

## Beta 11 - [IDE 713/Runtime 726 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A2024-12-11..2024-12-11)  (Dec 11, 2024)

- **macOS Monterey Support Restored**
    - Just the one fix in this release, so that Monterey remains supported for 2024.11 [#8669](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8669)
 
- **Other Notes**
    - No runtime update with this one, so it's still RT 726
    - Remember if you had Windows IDE updater problems previously you need to have installed IDE 710 first, then you will see the fixes already mentioned below when trying to update to this 713

<br>

## Beta 10 - [IDE 710/Runtime 726 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A2024-12-04..2024-12-10)  (Dec 10, 2024)

- {% include important.html content="MAC IDE USERS: we are aware that Monterey-and-older are not supported in this version - if you're on an old version of macOS do not attempt to install this release, as a 711+ will be coming soon (no need to send us a bug report, as we already have one)" %}

- **Windows Updater Fixes**
    - The updater now has additional short waits to hopefully avoid permissions/antivirus on some user's machines and make the installation more reliable
    - There is also a fix to stop being able to accidentally launch the updater twice on your Beta install folder
    - As ever, you won't see these fixes when installing 710 - we will be releasing a 711+ very soon, so that you can see the fixes when installing _that_ version
    - Note: If you previously had issues with the Windows IDE updater, then you need to install this 710 first of all (either via updater or via the installer yourself) and then you will be ready for that 711+ - at which point, please use the updater and let us know if all is well then

- **Misc Other fixes**
    - See the changelist above, as there are a few other smaller fixes in this release

<br>

## Beta 9 - [IDE 703/Runtime 719 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A2024-11-28..2024-12-03)  (Dec 4, 2024)

- **Just these couple of IDE fixes**
    - Docs Integration: Help > Required SDKs menubar option link/redirect no longer breaks when using Firefox as your default browser [#8536](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8536)
    - Licensing: "Forgotten Password" on Legacy Account dialog no longer opens a 404 page in your browser [#8588](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8588)
    - Note that the changelist above does show a few runtime changes also, but these were all in earlier 2024.1100 runtimes - it's just that the report has only been closed/updated more recently

<br>

## Beta 8 - [IDE 700/Runtime 718 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A2024-11-15..2024-11-27)  (Nov 28, 2024)

## Beta 7 - [IDE 686/Runtime 707 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A2024-11-07..2024-11-14)  (Nov 15, 2024)

- **Prefab Library Fixes/Changes**
    - {% include important.html content="If you have projects containing Prefabs, be aware that we renamed the packages and so you MUST remove the Prefab assets from your project to unlink the Prefab collection before you uninstall the obsolete Prefab from your Library, otherwise this will cause your project to throw a loading error about the old Prefab being missing" %}
    - The dock tab is now part of the default layout and so all new projects will have the Prefab Library quietly open in the bottom dock and ready for use [#8420](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8420)
    - Prefab Library: Top-level root shows everything, rather than just the collections [#8331](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8331)
    - Prefab Library: "Package Manager" button does not change the source to be prefabs if Package Manager is already open [#8418](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8418)
    - Prefab Library: Selecting multiple assets has no impact for Duplicate Into Project [#8421](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8421)
    - Prefab Library: Drop down menu is slightly obscured when using Simple view [#8419](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8419)

- **Fliter/Effect Layer Values Are Now Checked For Validity And Fixed Automatically**
    - For situations where you get an in-game error which says "Unknown Function argument 1 invalid reference to (sprite) - requested -1 max is" (like the below issue), we have now determined this is due to invalid values being set in the Room Editor for your filter/effect layer(s)
    - Accordingly, the Room Editor will now detect and fix up these invalid values, as these can have a variety of results in-game
    - However, be aware that you will need to open the room and click on the filter/effect layer(s) that is/are active at this point in your game in order for GameMaker to diagnose the problem - the fix cannot be applied without doing this bit yourself first
    - Building Projects / Project Load: Incorrect values in Dots filter in a room results in draw_sprite() crash in attached project, should catch and fix the filter [#8362](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8362)

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Bug Reporter: "Privately attach this project" should be reworded to again state all files are uploaded privately [#8173](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8173)

    - Code Editor 2: Debugger breaks when trying to step through multiple different events on one object [#8200](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8200)
    - Code Editor 2: Arguments in function declarations always appear in unset color [#6751](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6751)
    - Project Save: Deleting an instance's creation code unexpectedly triggers the File Watcher and clicking "reload" crashes GM [#8216](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8216)
    - Project Save: [Mac IDE] GM crash when trying to open a Save Dialog on my Mac [#8293](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8293)

- **Other Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Building Projects: [Android] Android Studio/JDK being newer than Required SDKs guide says can result in "source/target value 8 is obsolete" fail [#7951](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7951)
    - In-Game: SDF fonts are drawn blurry in 2024.1100 [#8324](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8324)
    - In-Game: [YYC] _Reverted_ the change in since Beta 5 for "Creating a large array literal via code can cause a silent crash" [#7082](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7082)
    - In Game: [YYC] Chained accessor referring to the wrong reference as of 2024.1100 Beta 6 [#8375](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8375)

## Beta 6 - [IDE 674/Runtime 700 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A2024-10-31..2024-11-06)  (Nov 7, 2024)

- **Prefab Library**
    - You can now enable a first look at the new Prefab Library and import our intitial batch of Prefabs into your projects
    - Prefabs are complete, standalone projects which help you quickly add more content into your games (like characters, sound packs, or gameplay mechanics/libraries, etc.)
    - You can drag prefabs from your library and drop them into the Room/Sequence/Object Editor to _link_ them to your project and use them right away - using this method the source files for the prefab are not added to your project's own source, but instead are pulled in during builds and added into your game packages
    - Or you can right-click the item and _duplicate_ something from a prefab collection into your project - using this method copies the prefab source into your own project's source and breaks the link to the original prefab, stopping it from using any later versions, but allowing you to now edit the files in your project
    - Open the Library inside your project by clicking "Windows > Prefab Library" and this will open the new bottom dock panel
    - Prefabs are then downloaded (once) using its Package Manager integration and then added to any of your projects thereafter from your library
    - For more on this feature, see [#4681](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4681)

- **Performance: Fixes For Stutters & Increasing RAM Usage Over Extended Sessions**
    - This release should remove a few ways in which you could see GameMaker performing worse over extended sessions of using the IDE
    - This was originally tracked in [#4424](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4424) for the Mac IDE, but various other issues are along similar lines - and be aware also that all changes/fixes in this release apply to the Windows/Mac/Ubuntu IDEs
    - If you do still have this problem, please report a new issue rather than commenting on any of the older issues, as we will want the fresh logs and information about your individual machine

- **Game Options: Removed "Generate Mipmaps For Separate Texture Pages" Setting**
    - This Game Option has been redundant for a while, because in recent GameMaker versions you have managed this value in the Texture Groups editor
    - Accordingly, the Game Option has been removed from the IDE now
    - However, note that the existing value will be left in your project source files, just in case for some reason you need to use an older IDE again
    - For more, see [#7045](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7045)

- **Game Options: Changes To "Automatically Remove Unused Assets When Compiling"**
    - Now defaults to OFF when opening/importing projects created in older IDEs than these 2024.1100 Betas (still defaults to ON for newly-created projects)
    - Also now counts and logs out the names of the assets that will be ignored during the build process (grouped by asset type, all of that type on the same line)
    - Note that the new Prefabs feature will still process all unused assets off in the prefabs you're using and ignore them during builds, regardless of whether the Game Option is on or off, as the Game Option only applies to assets 
    - For a little more on both of these changes and an example of the new logging, see [#8312](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8312)

- **matrix_inverse() Added**
    - Added a new function for inverting the matrix you supply [#2960](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2960)

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Code Editor 2: Converting back and forth between GML code and GML visual can display an empty window until reopened or completely delete the code [#7890](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7890)
    - Code Editor 2: Changing workspace tabs while the debugger is open can cause a second "Edit" menubar entry to appear [#8032](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8032)
    - Code Editor 2: No autocomplete at all when typing inside a static method [#7766](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7766)
    - ProjectTool: Does not strip Particle Tracks out of Sequence assets when exporting to LTS22 format [#8076](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8076)
    - Sprite Editor: A number of fixes to stop crashes when importing SVG images which contain unsupported features
    - UI/UX: Ctrl key doesn't work for subsequent shortcuts until you release and press it again [#2481](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2481)
    - UI/UX: Allow extending the size of all docks to 90% of screen, rather than only 40% [#8323](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8323)
    - Updater: [Mac/Ubu IDEs] Help menu item for checking for updates should be hidden on these IDEs [#8255](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8255)

- **Other Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Building Projects: [Android] Extensions with conditional code-injection only injects the nested part of the expected result [#8219](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8219)
    - In-Game: "other" behaviour changes in 2024.1100 appear completely broken with chained static methods [#8251](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8251)
    - In-Game: Audio loop functions now print warnings to the game log if the loop section bounds were clipped [#8037](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8037)
    - In-Game: Particle System is not being affected by matrix changes when drawn manually [#7561](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7561)
    - In-Game: [Android] Freeze when loading files from the .apk as a .zip file, due to a threading problem [#7839](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7839)
    - In-Game: [HTML5] Pixels with alpha of 0 in a Tileset sprite still count for collisions [#8264](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8264)
    - In-Game: [macOS] "Large Blur Filter" does not display correctly on Intel-based Macs [#8205](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8205)
    - In-Game: [Ubuntu] application_surface / window size is set incorrectly at game start in 2024.1100 RTs [#8178](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8178)

## Beta 5 - [IDE 665/Runtime 691 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A2024-10-29..2024-10-30)  (Oct 31, 2024)

- **New Windows IDE Updater**
    - If you have installed Beta 4 (IDE 659) already, then your Windows IDE will now alert you to this new version using the new dialogs and allow you to start the automatic update process detailed in the earlier release notes below
    - If you are coming from an older Beta IDE, then you won't - if you want to see the new stuff, please temporarily install IDE 659 instead and then _it_ will prompt you: [Windows](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2024.1100.0.659.exe)
    - Note that there are a handful of public bug reports for Updater UI changes and which you will see are marked as fixed already - be aware that your updater in this release came from IDE 659, so you won't see these fixes until whenever we release a _future_ Beta IDE
    - Again, this is only for the Windows IDE

- **SVGs: Anti-Aliasing Support Added**
    - The anti-aliasing functions for SVG images have now been added and can be used in-game
    - Exactly the same naming format as the SWF
 
- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Code Editor 2: "Fold/Unfold Region" hotkey and menubar option do not work [#8008](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8008)
    - Preferences: GM unstable when clicking "Restore Default Colours" button for Code Editor 2 section if no theme is already selected [#7787](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7787)
    - Sequence Editor: Hotkeys for editing a curve do not work [#7233](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7233)
    - UI/UX: Laptop Mode being enabled means you cannot use shift to perform multi-selection in various editors [#7496](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7496)

- **Other Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Building Projects: [iOS] Add "add -FIRDebugEnabled" to the launch options so that the Firebase extension can work [#8183](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8183)
    - Building Projects: [Windows] Unhandled exception when adding an invalid Unicode sequence within a string [#8117](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8117)

<br>

## Beta 4 - [IDE 659/Runtime 685 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A2024-10-24..2024-10-28)  (Oct 29, 2024)

- **New Windows IDE Updater**
    - Now, you won't actually see the evidence of this one until the _next_ Beta we release (as there is no newer version to update to), but be aware that this release does include the new in-IDE updater for Windows IDEs (not Mac or Ubuntu!)
    - This new system removes the IDE update notification early on startup and instead moves it to appear when the Start Page has loaded
    - At which point, you can ask GameMaker to download the new installer in the background while you continue working if you wish
    - Once the download is ready, GameMaker will ask if you want to restart and silently/automatically install the new version now, or wait and do it the next time you are asked
    - If you choose "Yes" you will see a simple progress bar while the new version is installed for you - which can take a couple of minutes, as your runtimes are downloaded also
    - [#3157](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3157)

- **New Game Option For Not Building Unused Assets Into Your Export Packages**
    - You can now enable whether during builds GameMaker should automatically ignore any unused assets in your projects, so that these assets are not added into your game packages (the project itself is obviously not modified and the unused assets are safely left alone)
    - Game Options > Main > "Automatically remove unused assets when compiling"
    - Note that this defaults to ON for newly-created projects, so if you do have any issues when this Game Option is enabled, please do send us a bug report and allow GameMaker to attach your project before you consider turning the feature off again
    - For more on this new feature, see [#3597](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3597)
    - {% include important.html content="If you created a project in any recent IDE starting with 2024.4 your Game Option value will already be ON as well, as GameMaker IDEs have quietly known about this feature for a while - however, the setting won't affect your builds if you're using those older runtimes" %}
    - {% include note.html content="Scribble users: _older_ versions of Scribble always checked all font indexes and so if this setting is enabled Scribble will throw an in-game error when it finds a font is missing - you will need to change this code yourself or update your copy of Scribble ([#8198](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8198))" %}

- **Removed the "Functions declared in an Object's event are now more easily-accessed by other events in that Object" feature**
    - We have removed the feature to declare functions within Object events and more-easily access them in other events within that Object, as there were too many problems found with introducing this change into the GMS2 runtimes
    - It will no longer be part of 2024.11
    - See [#8129](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8129) for the final issue that resulted in the feature being removed, but be aware that a number of bug fixes in Betas 2 and 3 are now redundant/reverted also See [#8129](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8129)
 
- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Code Editor 2: Tabs are removed when pasting code [#6243](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6243)
    - Code Editor 2: Can't scroll to end of lines using the scrollbars, stops 1 character too soon [#8113](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8113)

    - You can now import and preview some SVG images, then this will carry through to your game at build time
    - Note that several parts of SVG image functionality are not implemented yet, so you may well find some images refuse to import in 2024.11, and also no anti-aliasing support in-game has been added yet (this bit will come in another Beta soon and will be done ahead of 2024.11)
    - See this issue for details - [#5895](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5895)

- **Static initialisation no longer runs multiple times as of 2024.11, so added a method of restoring old behaviour**
    - See this issue for details - [#7888](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7888)

- **Console SDK Support Updated Again**
    - All console targets have now been updated to require new versions (yes, again - even since the last two Betas below...)
    - {% include important.html content="See their individual Required SDKs FAQs before doing any builds! You will need to update your SDK installations and flash your device with the new firmware before any builds will succeed!" %}

## Beta 2 - [IDE 634/Runtime 658 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A2024-09-23..2024-10-02)  (Oct 3, 2024)

Although the public changelist for this Beta is pretty small, this version actually moves various bits of the IDE to be new plugins rather than all in the main content - if all goes to plan, you won't see any difference at all, but if you do see anything new and "odd" with the UI in this version, please file a bug report. 

- **Code Editor 2 support for GML Visual**
     - Support for this has now been greatly improved as of this release
     - For more info, see [#7769](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7769)

- **Console SDK Support Updated**
    - Switch and Xbox targets have now been updated to require new versions
    - {% include important.html content="See their individual Required SDKs FAQs before doing any builds! You will need to update your SDK installations and flash your device with the new firmware before any builds will succeed!" %}

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Project Import: [Mac IDE] Now able to convert old-format projects again in 2024.1100 Beta IDEs [#7756](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7756)
    - Project Load: Fixed that the UI seized when loading large(r) projects in internal 2024.1100 IDEs and no spinner would be shown and other UI could break [just FYI, as this was not in a public release...]
    - Sound Editor: [Mac IDE] GM crashes on M-series Macs when creating/opening sounds if Rosetta is not installed [#2592](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2592)
    - UI/UX: Enabling CE2 when there are unsaved project changes now actually prompts you to save those changes (note that this also affected several other Preferences which required the IDE to restart before they applied) [#7755](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7755)

- **Other Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Building Projects: Compiler optimisation for mod operator % is now fixed, stops a "Modulo by 0" error in Beta 1 [#7705](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7705)
    - Building Projects: [HTML5] Streamed sound in Included Files is now exported correctly in the attached project [#7806](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7806)
    - In-Game: Stopping an inaudible voice now makes it immediately stealable [#7789](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7789)
    - In-Game: Constructor inheritance is no longer broken due to new code error that was added in Beta 1 [#7752](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7752)
    - In-Game: [Android] Fixed OpenAL Errors for compressed streamed audio [#7562](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7562)
    - In-Game: game_restart() now clears out time sources created by call_later() [#7403](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7403)
    - In-Game: real() now throws errors for strings that start with a number but have trailing characters (e.g., "infobar", "nano", "42 apples") [#7685](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7685)

## Beta 1 - [IDE 626/Runtime 652 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A<2024-09-23)  (Sept 24, 2024)

_We are aware that Mac IDE users will have problems trying to import very old-format projects in this version ([#7756](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7756)) - this will be fixed soon and there is no need to send additional bug reports_

- **Code Editor 2 Improvements**
    - There are far too many to list here, so please see [this filtered change list](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A<2024-09-23+"Code+Editor+2")
    - Be aware that there are still lots of Code Editor 2 changes/fixes left to come in these Betas, but the ones above are in already 

- **Code Editor 2 support in the Debugger Window**
     - Support for this has now been greatly improved as of this release
     - For more info, see [#5348](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5348)

- **Windows - ARM64 Device Support**
    - You can now create games that target ARM64 Windows devices
    - For Run/Debug the application will detect what the current device is and automatically run the correct runner (i.e. x64 or arm64)
    - For Create Exe there are new choices on the dialog, so you can choose to build an ARM64 Zip or an ARM64 NSIS otuput as well as the existing package types
    - Note that you can use Task Manager to see the architecture of the application and confirm that the ARM64 version is being run on your ARM64 device, but this is a hidden column in the _Details_ window, so you need to enable it yourself in Task Manager first

- **GX.games - New .Zip Package Type**
    - Added a new "save as .zip" output type when clicking Create Exe
    - This is intended only for those who want to use the WASM package that the GX.games target creates for you, but on your own website rather than on the GX Community (and so you have webhosting and a suitable web page already)

- **IDE Graphical Stability Fixes**
    - Reverted the use of a newer version of the input/rendering libraries, as this should resolve reports of large areas of GameMaker flickering white/black in releases after 2024.2.0 on some AMD GPU laptops which use DPI overrides above 100%
    - Similar issues with flickering/rendering/offsets may well also be fixed now

- ** Functions declared in an Object's event are now more easily-accessed by other events in that Object **
    - {% include important.html content="This feature has since been removed for Beta 4 and will no longer be part of 2024.11!" %}
    - ~~Any function that is declared in an event for an Object using the syntax `function NAME(){ ... }` is now accessible as a function name in all events for that Object - even if the event the function is declared in is never actually performed in-game~~
    - ~~This makes it easier to reuse code in the IDE, but also is more memory-efficient in-game~~
    - ~~Other objects are still able to call the function (using the format `[objectName].NAME()`) and it remains the case that if you want to do this, then an instance of the object which defined the function must exist in the room at that time~~
    - ~~Note that functions are no longer assigned to the object, so variable_instance_get_names() will now not return the function name~~
    - ~~For more info, see [#7865](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7865)~~
    - ~~Be aware that Feather is not updated to account for this change yet, so there is no need to report a bug for this ([#7680](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7680))~~

- **Added support for `other` to be the originating `self` when used inside methods**
    - For more info, see [#7349](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7349)

- **Added functions to minimise/restore game windows**
    - window_minimise() and window_restore() functions have been added for desktop platforms
    - Although, be aware that macOS will not respond to the restore function, as games are paused when they lose focus
    - For more info, see [#7102](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7102)

- **Strict error-checking behaviours for audio functions**
    - This release will now more reliably catch when there are errors with audio playback due to invalid assets or arguments, etc., in your code
    - In general, you will want to review these in-game errors and refactor your code to correct the problem, as the error message is there to advise you have _always_ had a problem with your project and that previous runtimes would not have been doing what you were expecting
    - However, `audio_throw_on_error()` has been added also for disabling these stricter checks if you do need to
    - For more info, see [#7285](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7285)

- **Decoupled audio-decoding threads from the audio context**
    - For more info, see [#7055](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7055)
    - Also fixes "In-Game: Audio playback no longer cuts sounds off early when using 2028.8 runtimes" [#7597](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7597)

- **Console SDK Support Updated**
    - Both PlayStation targets have now been updated to require new versions
    - {% include important.html content="See their individual Required SDKs FAQs before doing any builds! You will need to update your SDK installations and flash your device with the new firmware before any builds will succeed!" %}

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Code Editor/Manual Content: Renamed the arguments for the various copy functions of data structures so they use a consistent name and order of "(destination, source)" [#7434](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7434)
    - Debugger: Breakpoints now persist between IDE sessions [#7306](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7306)

    - Feather: Parameter tooltip is now shown automatically when you type and dismiss the hover tooltip [#7133](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7133)
    - Licensing: Online checks no longer fail when a broken IPv6 default route is present (fixes issues with long startup times or being unable to sign-in) [#7152](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7152)
    - Preferences: Shows the expected runtime for this IDE on the Runtime Feeds page [#7008](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7008)
    - Room Editor: GM no longer goes unstable when moving a layer inside a locked folder in the layers panel [#7353](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7353)
