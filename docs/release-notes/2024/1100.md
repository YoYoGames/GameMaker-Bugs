Download Links: [Windows](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2024.1100.0.634.exe) - [macOS](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-2024.1100.0.634.pkg) - [Ubuntu Beta](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Beta-2024.1100.0.634.deb)

## Beta 2 - [IDE 634/Runtime 658 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A2024-09-23..2024-10-02)  (Oct 3, 2024)

Although the public changelist for this Beta is pretty small, this version actually moves various bits of the IDE to be new plugins rather than all in the main content - if all goes to plan, you won't see any difference at all, but if you do see anything new and "odd" with the UI in this version, please file a bug report. 

- **Code Editor 2 support for GML Visual**
     - Support for this has now been greatly improved as of this release
     - For more info, see [#7769](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7769)

- **Console SDK Support Updated**
    - Switch and Xbox targets have now been updated to require new versions
    - {% include important.html content="See their individual Required SDKs FAQs before doing any builds! You will need to update your SDK installations and flash your device with the new firmware before any builds will succeed!" %}

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Project Import: [Mac IDE] Now able to convert old-format projects again in 2024.1100 Beta IDEs [#7756](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7756)
    - Project Load: Fixed that the UI seized when loading large(r) projects in internal 2024.1100 IDEs and no spinner would be shown and other UI could break [just FYI, as this was not in a public release...]
    - Sound Editor: [Mac IDE] GM crashes on M-series Macs when creating/opening sounds if Rosetta is not installed [#2592](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2592)
    - UI/UX: Enabling CE2 when there are unsaved project changes now actually prompts you to save those changes (note that this also affected several other Preferences which required the IDE to restart before they applied) [#7755](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7755)

- **Other Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Building Projects: Compiler optimisation for mod operator % is now fixed, stops a "Modulo by 0" error in Beta 1 [#7705](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7705)
    - Building Projects: [HTML5] Streamed sound in Included Files is now exported correctly in the attached project [#7806](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7806)
    - In-Game: Stopping an inaudible voice now makes it immediately stealable [#7789](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7789)
    - In-Game: Constructor inheritance is no longer broken due to new code error that was added in Beta 1 [#7752](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7752)
    - In-Game: [Android] Fixed OpenAL Errors for compressed streamed audio [#7562](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7562)
    - In-Game: game_restart() now clears out time sources created by call_later() [#7403](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7403)
    - In-Game: real() now throws errors for strings that start with a number but have trailing characters (e.g., "infobar", "nano", "42 apples") [#7685](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7685)

## Beta 1 - [IDE 626/Runtime 652 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A<2024-09-23)  (Sept 24, 2024)

_We are aware that Mac IDE users will have problems trying to import very old-format projects in this version ([#7756](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7756)) - this will be fixed soon and there is no need to send additional bug reports_

- **Code Editor 2 Improvements**
    - There are far too many to list here, so please see [this filtered change list](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A<2024-09-23+"Code+Editor+2")
    - Be aware that there are still lots of Code Editor 2 changes/fixes left to come in these Betas, but the ones above are in already 

- **Code Editor 2 support in the Debugger Window**
     - Support for this has now been greatly improved as of this release
     - For more info, see [#5348](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5348)

- **Windows - ARM64 Device Support**
    - You can now create games that target ARM64 Windows devices
    - For Run/Debug the application will detect what the current device is and automatically run the correct runner (i.e. x64 or arm64)
    - For Create Exe there are new choices on the dialog, so you can choose to build an ARM64 Zip or an ARM64 NSIS otuput as well as the existing package types
    - Note that you can use Task Manager to see the architecture of the application and confirm that the ARM64 version is being run on your ARM64 device, but this is a hidden column in the _Details_ window, so you need to enable it yourself in Task Manager first

- **GX.games - New .Zip Package Type**
    - Added a new "save as .zip" output type when clicking Create Exe
    - This is intended only for those who want to use the WASM package that the GX.games target creates for you, but on your own website rather than on the GX Community (and so you have webhosting and a suitable web page already)

- **IDE Graphical Stability Fixes**
    - Reverted the use of a newer version of the input/rendering libraries, as this should resolve reports of large areas of GameMaker flickering white/black in releases after 2024.2.0 on some AMD GPU laptops which use DPI overrides above 100%
    - Similar issues with flickering/rendering/offsets may well also be fixed now

- **Functions declared in an Object's event are now more easily-accessed by other events in that Object**
    - Any function that is declared in an event for an Object using the syntax `function NAME(){ ... }` is now accessible as a function name in all events for that Object - even if the event the function is declared in is never actually performed in-game
    - This makes it easier to reuse code in the IDE, but also is more memory-efficient in-game
    - Other objects are still able to call the function (using the format `[objectName].NAME()`) and it remains the case that if you want to do this, then an instance of the object which defined the function must exist in the room at that time
    - Note that functions are no longer assigned to the object, so variable_instance_get_names() will now not return the function name
    - For more info, see [#7865](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7865)
    - Be aware that Feather is not updated to account for this change yet, so there is no need to report a bug for this ([#7680](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7680))

- **Added support for `other` to be the originating `self` when used inside methods**
    - For more info, see [#7349](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7349)

- **Added functions to minimise/restore game windows**
    - window_minimise() and window_restore() functions have been added for desktop platforms
    - Although, be aware that macOS will not respond to the restore function, as games are paused when they lose focus
    - For more info, see [#7102](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7102)

- **Strict error-checking behaviours for audio functions**
    - This release will now more reliably catch when there are errors with audio playback due to invalid assets or arguments, etc., in your code
    - In general, you will want to review these in-game errors and refactor your code to correct the problem, as the error message is there to advise you have _always_ had a problem with your project and that previous runtimes would not have been doing what you were expecting
    - However, `audio_throw_on_error()` has been added also for disabling these stricter checks if you do need to
    - For more info, see [#7285](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7285)

- **Decoupled audio-decoding threads from the audio context**
    - For more info, see [#7055](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7055)
    - Also fixes "In-Game: Audio playback no longer cuts sounds off early when using 2028.8 runtimes" [#7597](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7597)

- **Console SDK Support Updated**
    - Both PlayStation targets have now been updated to require new versions
    - {% include important.html content="See their individual Required SDKs FAQs before doing any builds! You will need to update your SDK installations and flash your device with the new firmware before any builds will succeed!" %}

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Code Editor/Manual Content: Renamed the arguments for the various copy functions of data structures so they use a consistent name and order of "(destination, source)" [#7434](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7434)
