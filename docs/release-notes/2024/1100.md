Download Links: [Windows](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2024.1100.0.626.exe) - [macOS](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-2024.1100.0.626.pkg) - [Ubuntu Beta](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Beta-2024.1100.0.626.deb)

## Beta 1 - [IDE 626/Runtime 652 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A<2024-09-23)  (Sept 24, 2024)

_We are aware that Mac IDE users will have problems trying to import very old-format projects in this version ([#7756](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7756)) - this will be fixed soon and there is no need to send additional bug reports_

- **Code Editor 2 Improvements**
    - There are far too many to list here, so please see [this filtered change list](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A<2024-09-23+"Code+Editor+2")
    - Be aware that there are still lots of Code Editor 2 changes/fixes left to come in these Betas, but the ones above are in already 

- **GX.games - New .Zip Package Type**
    - Added a new "save as .zip" output type when clicking Create Exe
    - This is intended only for those who want to use the WASM package that the GX.games target creates for you, but on your own website rather than on the GX Community (and so you have webhosting and a suitable web page already)

- **IDE Graphical Stability Fixes**
    - Reverted the use of a newer version of the input/rendering libraries, as this should resolve reports of large areas of GameMaker flickering white/black in releases after 2024.2.0 on some AMD GPU laptops which use DPI overrides above 100%
    - Similar issues with flickering/rendering/offsets may well also be fixed now

- **Functions declared in an Object's event are now more easily-accessed**
    - Any function that is declared in an event for an Object using the syntax `function NAME(){ ... }` is now accessible as a function name in all events for that Object, plus for all other objects if they call it using the format `[objectName].NAME()`
    - Note that if you want other objects to be able to call the function, then an instance of the object which defined the functions must exist in the room at that time
    - For more info, see [#7125](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7125)
    - Be aware that Feather is not updated to account for this change yet, so there is no need to report a bug for this ([#7680](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7680))

- **Added support for `other` to be the originating `self` when used inside methods**
    - For more info, see [#7349](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7349)

- **Added functions to minimise/restore game windows**
    - window_minimise() and window_restore() functions have been added for desktop platforms
    - Although, be aware that macOS will not respond to the restore function, as games are paused when they lose focus
    - For more info, see [#7102](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7102)

- **Strict error-checking behaviours for audio functions**
    - This release will now more reliably catch when there are errors with audio playback due to invalid assets or arguments, etc., in your code
    - In general, you will want to review these in-game errors and refactor your code to correct the problem, as the error message is there to advise you have _always_ had a problem with your project and that previous runtimes would not have been doing what you were expecting
    - However, `audio_throw_on_error()` has been added also for disabling these stricter checks if you do need to
    - For more info, see [#7285](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7285)

- **Decoupled audio-decoding threads from the audio context**
    - For more info, see [#7055](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7055)
    - Also fixes "In-Game: Audio playback no longer cuts sounds off early when using 2028.8 runtimes" [#7597](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7597)

- **Console SDK Support Updated**
    - Both PlayStation targets have now been updated to require new versions
    - {% include important.html content="See their individual Required SDKs FAQs before doing any builds! You will need to update your SDK installations and flash your device with the new firmware before any builds will succeed!" %}
