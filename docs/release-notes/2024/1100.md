# 2024.1100 - Current Version: IDE 665/Runtime 691 

Download Links: [Windows](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2024.1100.0.665.exe) - [macOS](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-2024.1100.0.665.pkg) - [Ubuntu Beta](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Beta-2024.1100.0.665.deb)

## Beta 5 - [IDE 665/Runtime 691 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A2024-10-29..2024-10-30)  (Oct 31, 2024)

- **New Windows IDE Updater**
    - If you have installed Beta 4 (IDE 659) already, then your Windows IDE will now alert you to this new version using the new dialogs and allow you to start the automatic update process detailed in the earlier release notes below
    - If you are coming from an older Beta IDE, then you won't - if you want to see the new stuff, please temporarily install IDE 659 instead and then _it_ will prompt you: [Windows](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2024.1100.0.659.exe)
    - Note that there are a handful of public bug reports for Updater UI changes and which you will see are marked as fixed already - be aware that your updater in this release came from IDE 659, so you won't see these fixes until whenever we release a _future_ Beta IDE
    - Again, this is only for the Windows IDE

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Code Editor 2: "Fold/Unfold Region" hotkey and menubar option do not work [#8008](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8008)
    - Preferences: GM unstable when clicking "Restore Default Colours" button for Code Editor 2 section if no theme is already selected [#7787](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7787)
    - Sequence Editor: Hotkeys for editing a curve do not work [#7233](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7233)
    - UI/UX: Laptop Mode being enabled means you cannot use shift to perform multi-selection in various editors [#7496](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7496)

- **Other Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Building Projects: [iOS] Add "add -FIRDebugEnabled" to the launch options so that the Firebase extension can work [#8183](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8183)
    - Building Projects: [Windows] Unhandled exception when adding an invalid Unicode sequence within a string [#8117](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8117)

## Beta 4 - [IDE 659/Runtime 685 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A2024-10-24..2024-10-28)  (Oct 29, 2024)

- **New Windows IDE Updater**
    - Now, you won't actually see the evidence of this one until the _next_ Beta we release (as there is no newer version to update to), but be aware that this release does include the new in-IDE updater for Windows IDEs (not Mac or Ubuntu!)
    - This new system removes the IDE update notification early on startup and instead moves it to appear when the Start Page has loaded
    - At which point, you can ask GameMaker to download the new installer in the background while you continue working if you wish
    - Once the download is ready, GameMaker will ask if you want to restart and silently/automatically install the new version now, or wait and do it the next time you are asked
    - If you choose "Yes" you will see a simple progress bar while the new version is installed for you - which can take a couple of minutes, as your runtimes are downloaded also
    - [#3157](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3157)

- **New Game Option For Not Building Unused Assets Into Your Export Packages**
    - You can now enable whether during builds GameMaker should automatically ignore any unused assets in your projects, so that these assets are not added into your game packages (the project itself is obviously not modified and the unused assets are safely left alone)
    - Game Options > Main > "Automatically remove unused assets when compiling"
    - Note that this defaults to ON in 2024.11, so if you do have any issues when this Game Option is enabled, please do send us a bug report and allow GameMaker to attach your project before you consider turning the feature off again
    - Be aware also that creating/editing a project in 2024.11 and then opening it in any older "2024." IDE will still show and obey this Game Option, as GameMaker IDEs have quietly known about this feature for a while - however, you would then be subject to bugs with this functionality that are only fixed as of 2024.11, so you may need to remember turn the Game Option off if you need to use an older IDE
    - And finally, there is a known issue with the Scribble asset, in that _older_ versions of Scribble always checked all font indexes and so if this setting is enabled Scribble will throw an error when it finds one is missing - you will need to change this code yourself or update your copy of Scribble ([#8198](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8198))
    - For more on this new feature, see [#3597](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3597)

- **Removed the "Functions declared in an Object's event are now more easily-accessed by other events in that Object" feature**
    - We have removed the feature to declare functions within Object events and more-easily access them in other events within that Object, as there were too many problems found with introducing this change into the GMS2 runtimes
    - It will no longer be part of 2024.11
    - See [#8129](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8129) for the final issue that resulted in the feature being removed, but be aware that a number of bug fixes in Betas 2 and 3 are now redundant/reverted also See [#8129](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8129)
 
- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Code Editor 2: Tabs are removed when pasting code [#6243](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6243)
    - Code Editor 2: Can't scroll to end of lines using the scrollbars, stops 1 character too soon [#8113](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8113)
    - Docs Integration: [Mac IDE] GM crash when failing to download the manual .zip due to antivirus/OS permissions blocking the file write [#7540](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7540)
    - Layouts Menu: GM unstable when selecting Show/Close All Windows in 2024.1100 Betas [#8101](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8101)
    - Startup: Menubar buttons are visible too early during start of 2024.1100 Betas since Start Page became a plugin [#7884](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7884)

- **Other Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Building Projects: [Mac IDE] [Android] Creating an ".aab" file on a Sequoia Mac creates it as an ".aab.aa.apk" file instead [#7981](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7981)
    - In-Game: Audio loop functions now print warnings to the game log if the loop section bounds were clipped [#8037](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8037)
    - In-Game: Function declaration is broken in object inheritance in Nov beta runtime [#8129](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8129)
    - In-Game: [YYC] Creating a large array literal via code can cause a silent crash [#7082](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7082)

    - In-Game: [HTML5] Recycling a voice which is requesting data does not abort the request [#8121](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8121)
    - In-Game: variable_clone() gives incorrect results for methods that have variables bound [#7994](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7994)

    - This release has an early look at ther upcoming SVG graphics support in the IDE and in-game
    - You can now import and preview some SVG images, then this will carry through to your game at build time
    - Note that several parts of SVG image functionality are not implemented yet, so you may well find some images refuse to import in 2024.11, and also no anti-aliasing support in-game has been added yet (this bit will come in another Beta soon and will be done ahead of 2024.11)
    - See this issue for details - [#5895](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5895)

    - See this issue for details - [#8138](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8138)

- **Static initialisation no longer runs multiple times as of 2024.11, so added a method of restoring old behaviour**
    - See this issue for details - [#7888](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7888)

- **Console SDK Support Updated Again**
    - All console targets have now been updated to require new versions (yes, again - even since the last two Betas below...)
    - {% include important.html content="See their individual Required SDKs FAQs before doing any builds! You will need to update your SDK installations and flash your device with the new firmware before any builds will succeed!" %}

## Beta 2 - [IDE 634/Runtime 658 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A2024-09-23..2024-10-02)  (Oct 3, 2024)

Although the public changelist for this Beta is pretty small, this version actually moves various bits of the IDE to be new plugins rather than all in the main content - if all goes to plan, you won't see any difference at all, but if you do see anything new and "odd" with the UI in this version, please file a bug report. 

- **Code Editor 2 support for GML Visual**
     - Support for this has now been greatly improved as of this release
     - For more info, see [#7769](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7769)

- **Console SDK Support Updated**
    - Switch and Xbox targets have now been updated to require new versions
    - {% include important.html content="See their individual Required SDKs FAQs before doing any builds! You will need to update your SDK installations and flash your device with the new firmware before any builds will succeed!" %}

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Project Import: [Mac IDE] Now able to convert old-format projects again in 2024.1100 Beta IDEs [#7756](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7756)
    - Project Load: Fixed that the UI seized when loading large(r) projects in internal 2024.1100 IDEs and no spinner would be shown and other UI could break [just FYI, as this was not in a public release...]
    - Sound Editor: [Mac IDE] GM crashes on M-series Macs when creating/opening sounds if Rosetta is not installed [#2592](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2592)
    - UI/UX: Enabling CE2 when there are unsaved project changes now actually prompts you to save those changes (note that this also affected several other Preferences which required the IDE to restart before they applied) [#7755](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7755)

- **Other Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Building Projects: Compiler optimisation for mod operator % is now fixed, stops a "Modulo by 0" error in Beta 1 [#7705](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7705)
    - Building Projects: [HTML5] Streamed sound in Included Files is now exported correctly in the attached project [#7806](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7806)
    - In-Game: Stopping an inaudible voice now makes it immediately stealable [#7789](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7789)
    - In-Game: Constructor inheritance is no longer broken due to new code error that was added in Beta 1 [#7752](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7752)
    - In-Game: [Android] Fixed OpenAL Errors for compressed streamed audio [#7562](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7562)
    - In-Game: game_restart() now clears out time sources created by call_later() [#7403](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7403)
    - In-Game: real() now throws errors for strings that start with a number but have trailing characters (e.g., "infobar", "nano", "42 apples") [#7685](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7685)

<br>

## Beta 1 - [IDE 626/Runtime 652 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A<2024-09-23)  (Sept 24, 2024)

_We are aware that Mac IDE users will have problems trying to import very old-format projects in this version ([#7756](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7756)) - this will be fixed soon and there is no need to send additional bug reports_

- **Code Editor 2 Improvements**
    - There are far too many to list here, so please see [this filtered change list](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.11+closed%3A<2024-09-23+"Code+Editor+2")
    - Be aware that there are still lots of Code Editor 2 changes/fixes left to come in these Betas, but the ones above are in already 

- **Code Editor 2 support in the Debugger Window**
     - Support for this has now been greatly improved as of this release
     - For more info, see [#5348](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5348)

- **Windows - ARM64 Device Support**
    - You can now create games that target ARM64 Windows devices
    - For Run/Debug the application will detect what the current device is and automatically run the correct runner (i.e. x64 or arm64)
    - For Create Exe there are new choices on the dialog, so you can choose to build an ARM64 Zip or an ARM64 NSIS otuput as well as the existing package types
    - Note that you can use Task Manager to see the architecture of the application and confirm that the ARM64 version is being run on your ARM64 device, but this is a hidden column in the _Details_ window, so you need to enable it yourself in Task Manager first

- **GX.games - New .Zip Package Type**
    - Added a new "save as .zip" output type when clicking Create Exe
    - This is intended only for those who want to use the WASM package that the GX.games target creates for you, but on your own website rather than on the GX Community (and so you have webhosting and a suitable web page already)

- **IDE Graphical Stability Fixes**
    - Reverted the use of a newer version of the input/rendering libraries, as this should resolve reports of large areas of GameMaker flickering white/black in releases after 2024.2.0 on some AMD GPU laptops which use DPI overrides above 100%
    - Similar issues with flickering/rendering/offsets may well also be fixed now

- ** Functions declared in an Object's event are now more easily-accessed by other events in that Object **
    - {% include important.html content="This feature has since been removed for Beta 4 and will no longer be part of 2024.11!" %}
    - ~~Any function that is declared in an event for an Object using the syntax `function NAME(){ ... }` is now accessible as a function name in all events for that Object - even if the event the function is declared in is never actually performed in-game~~
    - ~~This makes it easier to reuse code in the IDE, but also is more memory-efficient in-game~~
    - ~~Other objects are still able to call the function (using the format `[objectName].NAME()`) and it remains the case that if you want to do this, then an instance of the object which defined the function must exist in the room at that time~~
    - ~~Note that functions are no longer assigned to the object, so variable_instance_get_names() will now not return the function name~~
    - ~~For more info, see [#7865](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7865)~~
    - ~~Be aware that Feather is not updated to account for this change yet, so there is no need to report a bug for this ([#7680](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7680))~~

- **Added support for `other` to be the originating `self` when used inside methods**
    - For more info, see [#7349](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7349)

- **Added functions to minimise/restore game windows**
    - window_minimise() and window_restore() functions have been added for desktop platforms
    - Although, be aware that macOS will not respond to the restore function, as games are paused when they lose focus
    - For more info, see [#7102](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7102)

- **Strict error-checking behaviours for audio functions**
    - This release will now more reliably catch when there are errors with audio playback due to invalid assets or arguments, etc., in your code
    - In general, you will want to review these in-game errors and refactor your code to correct the problem, as the error message is there to advise you have _always_ had a problem with your project and that previous runtimes would not have been doing what you were expecting
    - However, `audio_throw_on_error()` has been added also for disabling these stricter checks if you do need to
    - For more info, see [#7285](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7285)

- **Decoupled audio-decoding threads from the audio context**
    - For more info, see [#7055](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7055)
    - Also fixes "In-Game: Audio playback no longer cuts sounds off early when using 2028.8 runtimes" [#7597](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7597)

- **Console SDK Support Updated**
    - Both PlayStation targets have now been updated to require new versions
    - {% include important.html content="See their individual Required SDKs FAQs before doing any builds! You will need to update your SDK installations and flash your device with the new firmware before any builds will succeed!" %}
