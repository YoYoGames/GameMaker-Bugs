## Beta 1 - [IDE 921/Runtime 907 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14.1%20closed%3A<2025-11-06)  (Nov 6, 2025)


### Features Added Or Changed

- **New Login Flow**
    - Signing-in has always had different UI depending on whether you have an old "Legacy" account or a newer Opera SSO Account
    - Now, the "Legacy" UI has been removed from inside GameMaker and instead _all_ users will sign-in via the one button, which will open your web browser and allow you to sign-in there - once on the website, you will find the new Legacy option alongside the existing SSO one
    - Proxy server users: Be aware this release also moves the controls for saying whether you have a proxy server and which details you log in with, so you will now find these in Preferences > General Settings > Proxy Settings. (Any proxy values have always applied to all internet traffic and also to SSO sign-ins, so this should clear up any confusion.)

- **Filters/Effects And SDF Support Are Now Prefabs**
    - These items are no longer always part of the runner/your build and instead are added dynamically if your project requires them
    - That does mean that if you try to build a project which uses this functionality and you have not already linked the prefab to the project, then you will get a compile fail asking you to fix this / a dialog saying GameMaker fixed it for you
    - Right now, if you use SDF and the fonts now look incorrect in-game, open one of the fonts in the Font Editor and you will be asked to link the SDF plugin at that time
    - Once you have linked any missing prefab(s), just build your project again and that's that project sorted thereafter
    - Note: this process will be streamlined throughout the rest of 2024.1400/14 development to automate more of it for you and show fewer fails/dialogs, but in this first release you will need to double-click the errors yourself to quickly install or link the missing prefab

- **GM Now Creates Crash Dumps Even When It Recovers Enough To Close Itself Down [#11710](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11710)**
    - It was realised that in some cases where GM told you there was a problem and so it had to close, because it was able to close safely it didn't then create a crash dump or ask you to send anything to us so we would know about that problem and be able to fix it
    - Now, the cmd window will briefly appear when GM closes down and the crash reporter will appear the next time you start GM again
    
- **"Build" Folder Added To Seed .gitignore Files [#6976](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6976)**
    - Added a new entry into the auto-generated .gitignore file that GameMaker makes when you create new projects, so that the GMRT build folder is ignored by your git client
    - For users with existing projects, if you want to see how to make this same change retroactively, see the issue link above
    
- **GX.games: Removed "QR" and "Console" buttons from exported packages [#12183](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12183)**
    - These buttons are now removed when exporting using the Create Exe options
    - They do still appear for run/debug, as you'd expect

- **PlayStation 5: Updated  to 12.00 [#12361](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12361)**
    - You will need to update your install to this same version, otherwise builds will fail
    - See the console's wiki if you need further info

- **In-Game: New Add/Delete Functions For Spawning Particle Systems Created In The IDE With Customised Values [#12150](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12150)**
    - A new function has been added which can take edited values for a particle system emitter already created in the IDE and create a new instance of that system which uses the new values
    - Also, a matching function to delete the system when you're done with it

- **In-Game: instance_create_...() Now Allows "undefined" For Its Optional var_struct Parameter [#12218](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12218)**
    - The functions will now work if undefined is passed in as the optional `var_struct` parameter, using an empty struct as expected
    
- **Prefabs: Added Ability To Specify UI Layer Dependencies [#11817](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11817)**
    - Added a new "MarkUILayerAsUsed" command for gml_pragma() which you can use to specify that a certain Object/Script prefab depends on UI Layers being imported into the project automatically whenever that prefab is imported
    - E.g., `gml_pragma("MarkUILayerAsUsed", "Your UI Layer Name")`
