## Beta 2 - [IDE 926/Runtime 912 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14.1%20closed%3A2025-11-06..2025-11-12)  (Nov 13, 2025)

### Features Added Or Changed

- **In-Game: debug_event("ErrorOnWarning") Turns Warnings Into Code Error Dialogs Which Include A Callstack [#4118](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4118)**
    - In older runtime versions you would simply get a debug warning for a number of coding errors and there was no real information on how this problem had been encountered/where to look in your code in order tom go about fixing it
    - As some examples given on the issue, this is messages like "Grid Index Writing Out Of Bounds", "Error: Index did not map to an existing audio asset" which show up in your Output window
    - Now, you can call `debug_event("ErrorOnWarning")` somewhere early in your game and this will change all of these warnings into you being shown a code error dialog - at which point, you're now also shown a small callstack to help work out the steps that led up to this error being encountered
    - Note that there were several other old requests for this, so those have been marked as duplicates of #4118 and closed now

- **Device Manager: [iOS] Added support for a dummy device to be selected in Target Manager and used when building for iOS [#8413](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8413)**
    - Similar to how XCode allows you to build for "Any IOS Device", which can then be deployed via Testflight or to a real device later on, GameMaker now has a default/dummy iOS device in Target Manager that you can use and do iOS builds even when no real iPhone/iPad is connected to your Mac (this is particularly useful in the case of remote or CI build setups)
    - As you can see below, there have also been fixes for iOS and tvOS physical devices not being detected on some newer Mac hardware setups

<br>

### Crash/Stability Fixes

- More error-logging has been added for the below crashes that were reported recently but were not able to be reproduced (and look to be the result of an attempted update from .13. to .14 using the IDE updater, followed by running the installer over the top). If you reported one of those to us and you still have the issue in this new version, first of all please uninstall GameMaker and then reinstall using the full installer for this release (linked above) and then, if that still fails to fix it, file a new bug report and ensure your ui.log reaches us, please

- Prefabs: Fixed that sprite overrides do not function in prefab collections [#12011](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12011)

## Beta 1 - [IDE 921/Runtime 907 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14.1%20closed%3A<2025-11-06)  (Nov 6, 2025)

### Features Added Or Changed

- **New Login Flow**
    - Signing-in has always had different UI depending on whether you have an old "Legacy" account or a newer Opera SSO Account
    - Now, the "Legacy" UI has been removed from inside GameMaker and instead _all_ users will sign-in via the one button, which will open your web browser and allow you to sign-in there - once on the website, you will find the new Legacy option alongside the existing SSO one
    - Proxy server users: Be aware this release also moves the controls for saying whether you have a proxy server and which details you log in with, so you will now find these in Preferences > General Settings > Proxy Settings. (Any proxy values have always applied to all internet traffic and also to SSO sign-ins, so this should clear up any confusion.)

- **Filters/Effects And SDF Support Are Now Prefabs**
    - These items are no longer always part of the runner/your build and instead are added dynamically if your project requires them
    - That does mean that if you try to build a project which uses this functionality and you have not already linked the prefab to the project, then you will get a compile fail asking you to fix this / a dialog saying GameMaker fixed it for you
    - Right now, if you use SDF and the fonts now look incorrect in-game, open one of the fonts in the Font Editor and you will be asked to link the SDF plugin at that time
    - Once you have linked any missing prefab(s), just build your project again and that's that project sorted thereafter
    - Note: this process will be streamlined throughout the rest of 2024.1400/14 development to automate more of it for you and show fewer fails/dialogs, but in this first release you will need to double-click the errors yourself to quickly install or link the missing prefab

- **GM Now Creates Crash Dumps Even When It Recovers Enough To Close Itself Down [#11710](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11710)**
    - It was realised that in some cases where GM told you there was a problem and so it had to close, because it was able to close safely it didn't then create a crash dump or ask you to send anything to us so we would know about that problem and be able to fix it
    - Now, the cmd window will briefly appear when GM closes down and the crash reporter will appear the next time you start GM again
    
- **"Build" Folder Added To Seed .gitignore Files [#6976](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6976)**
    - Added a new entry into the auto-generated .gitignore file that GameMaker makes when you create new projects, so that the GMRT build folder is ignored by your git client
    - For users with existing projects, if you want to see how to make this same change retroactively, see the issue link above
    
- **GX.games: Removed "QR" and "Console" buttons from exported packages [#12183](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12183)**
    - These buttons are now removed when exporting using the Create Exe options
    - They do still appear for run/debug, as you'd expect

- **PlayStation 5: Updated  to 12.00 [#12361](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12361)**
    - You will need to update your install to this same version, otherwise builds will fail
    - See the console's wiki if you need further info

- **In-Game: New Add/Delete Functions For Spawning Particle Systems Created In The IDE With Customised Values [#12150](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12150)**
    - A new function has been added which can take edited values for a particle system emitter already created in the IDE and create a new instance of that system which uses the new values
    - Also, a matching function to delete the system when you're done with it

- **In-Game: instance_create_...() Now Allows "undefined" For Its Optional var_struct Parameter [#12218](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12218)**
    - The functions will now work if undefined is passed in as the optional `var_struct` parameter, using an empty struct as expected
    
- **Prefabs: Added Ability To Specify UI Layer Dependencies [#11817](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11817)**
    - Added a new "MarkUILayerAsUsed" command for gml_pragma() which you can use to specify that a certain Object/Script prefab depends on UI Layers being imported into the project automatically whenever that prefab is imported
    - E.g., `gml_pragma("MarkUILayerAsUsed", "Your UI Layer Name")`

- Project Load/Save: Attempted fix and also a lot more logging for GM 2024.14 crash when loading projects containing sounds/importing new sounds on my PC [#12485](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12485)
