# Original Release - Version 2024.8.0 (IDE 169/Runtime 216)  (Sept 3, 2024)

## IDE Featured Changes

- **Stalls/Freezes Fix**
    - A memory/performance issue has been found and fixed, which should greatly help reduce or hopefully eliminate freezes/stutters some users saw when editing their projects and scrolling/panning windows or typing in the code editor
    - This was most commonly reported as something which built up over time, or suddenly started after using GM for a while, but this time element has since been found to not be required and we could recreate the slow-down pretty soon after loading and working on a project by performing certain steps
    - For more information on the _types of actions_ or _areas of the IDE_ which saw these stutters on various users' machines, please see the long-running issue linked below - however, bear in mind that a lot of the information here is now out-of-date and was often speculative, so if you saw freezes but your experience doesn't exactly match what's written in that issue, be aware that you will _likely_ still see improvements from the change above
    - Performance: Short freezes/lag if GM kept open for a while after editing code [#2528](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2528)
    - If you _do_ still see freezes in this release, please report a **new** bug and ensure you provide _detailed_ steps/information on what you were doing when the stutters occured and also allow the IDE bug reporter to attach your project (please don't reply to that old issue now)

- **"Contact-Us Package" Tool Upgraded To Upload Your Files Privately**
    - Help > _Create Your Contact Us Package_ has now been upgraded to become _Help > Upload a Bug/Ticket Sample_ [#6375](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6375)
    - This tool still grabs all your log files automatically and turns them into a .zip file, but now the new dialog allows you to add an example project and any additional files you want to include and then, crucially, it will now **privately** upload the .zip to our server for you
    - You are then returned a URL (there's a clickable button to copy this to your OS clipboard) and you can add that URL onto any GitHub bug report or customer service ticket, safe in the knowledge that only GameMaker staff can access that upload (you can't even download it yourself)
    - This means you can now very easily add missing samples onto bug reports whenever we request a project, or send logs and other information in support of _other user's_ bug reports to show you have the same problem, etc. - you no longer need to report a duplicate copy of any bug report just to privately send us additional files!
    - {% include note.html content="If you're someone who prefers using the GitHub website forms for creating bug reports, rather than the IDE, then we would strongly recommend using this tool for all files you wish to link to on the bug report, rather than using any external fire-sharing host or attaching files publicly on the bug form" %}

- **Bug Reporter Now Warns About Mismatched IDE/Runtime Versions**
    - Due partly to a huge number of historical users coming back to GameMaker with the recent 2024.6.2 release (which is fantastic) and also partly due to a runtimes-checking bug in that one IDE version (which is not...), we saw a lot of reports recently from users who were using wildly out-of-date runtimes because their GameMaker install is not able to update their runtime and they have not noticed the problem before they sent a bug report
    - Accordingly, the bug reporter will now alert you when you're not using the correct runtime "family" that the current IDE you're using expects [#6866](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6866)
    - E.g., if you're _not_ using any "2024.8.whatever" runtime with the "2024.8.whatever" IDE, then the bug reporter will suggest that you update your GameMaker install or at least set the correct runtime as active and confirm if that stops the problem
    - This means you get the information on how and where to fix your GameMaker setup immediately and in most cases you then won't need to send a bug report
    - Note that it is valid to use different runtime versions to the IDE version, as you may want to stay on older runtimes in order to finish off a project before you update, and so the bug reporter will allow a _slightly_ newer/older runtime family to be used and still send a bug report
    - However, _very_ different runtimes (more than a couple of releases too old or too new) will block you from sending a bug report until you return to the correct versions
    - _A polite reminder to always read the release notes and then also search the bug database (or at the very least check the 3 pinned issues at the top of the page) before you send any reports!_
    - _And if you use **Steam** to run GameMaker, remember that there are additional important release notes on the Steam store page for your GameMaker install each time a new version is released._

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Bug Reporter: Improved the "PrivateIssueError" message to be something much more informative (the issue was always that your GameMaker account was not authorised on GitHub via the newer "Enterprise" button on your account panel) [#6836](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6836)
    - Bug Reporter: “Privately attach project” is now a drop-down and you must make a choice whether to send a project or not [#6353](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6353)
    - Code Editor: Ctrl+Q command now works reliably again [#5663](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5663)
    - Code Editor: shader_set_uniform_matrix() now expects something of type "id.Uniform" as its argument, rather than a "real" [#6201](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6201)
    - Debugger: RAM usage remains very high after viewing large surfaces, even after closing the debugger [#6821](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6821)
    - Debugger: If an instance bound is set to NaN when hitting a breakpoint this crashes the game before that break happens [#6818](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6818)
    - Debugger: Fixed game crashes when hitting a breakpoint and then moving the mouse cursor over the code to view the values in the attached project [#7237](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7237)
    - Debugger: Game no longer crashes when hitting a breakpoint inside path_point_adjust() in the attached project [#7237](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7237)
    - Image Editor: [Mac IDE] Fixed that GM went unstable when attempting to edit a sprite that has previously failed to load [#6747](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6747)
    - Inspector: [Objects] "Visible" and "Persistent" checkboxes were in a section called "Collision Mask", so this caused confusion - the section has now been renamed to "General Settings" and the one gadget that was actually to do with the collision mask now says this explicitly [#6645](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6645)
    - Preferences: [PS4, PS5] Visual Studio Location file selectors are now filtered to look for the correct/current "VsDevCmd.bat" file rather than the old "vcvars32.bat" version
    - Project Import: Fixed colour swaps of certain channels when importing a project with SWF assets from a previous version [#6392](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6392)
    - Redefine Keys: Added save/load functionality for saving out you user remaps to a file [#4838](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4838)
    - Room Editor: Brush Tool's "Alt" key functionality now works again [#5091](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5091)
    - Room Editor: Shift+Ctrl+LMB to add more items into an existing group selection now works again [#5984](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5984)
    - Room Editor: Editing inherited layers in a child room no longer causes the IDE to go unstable [#7246](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7246)
    - Room Editor: Deleting instances in the parent room will no longer corrupt them in its child [#7242](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7242)
    - Sequence Editor: GM no longer crashes when reordering tracks shortly after using a hotkey combination that changed focus [#6624](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6624)
    - Sprite Editor: Fixed that GM went unstable when moving multiple frames at once in the preview bar [#7041](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7041)
    - Sprite Editor: Fixed import of Spine sprite with no skin vertices or set to 0,0 [#1532](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/1532)
    - Start Page: Single-clicks on any Templates will now also set the right-hand panel ready for you to create a new project - you no longer have to click the template itself a second time [#6745](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6745)
    - Startup: [Win IDE] Fixed a GM crash on startup due to cryptography "Access Denied" exception when starting MQTT because the user on that machine does not have OS permissions sufficient to start the MQTT service [#6794](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6794)
    - Startup: [Win IDE] Fixed a GM crash when checking OSVersion value during startup sequence on some machines [#7359](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7359)

    - UI/UX: Fixed detached windows not showing Code Editors on reload [#6307](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6307)
    - UI/UX: [Mac IDE] Menubar interactions no longer become unreliable after opening the Source Control menu multiple times in an IDE session [#7192](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7192)


## Runtime Featured Changes

- **Flex Panels Support In-Game**
    - Lots of runtime functions have been added for enabling and controlling Flex Panel support in your games [#3160](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3160)
    - You can see a lot of these in the new function information lower down this page and how you might want to use them for screen layout management in your games
    - {% include note.html content="For a full list of the functions and how to use them please see [the Flex Panels page of the manual](https://manual.gamemaker.io/beta/en/#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Reference%2FFlex_Panels%2FFlex_Panels.htm)" %}

- **Android - Support For Newer Gradle Versions**
    - Added support for building projects on Android to use Gradle version v8.7/plugin version 8.5, as API 34+ requests [#5906](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5906)
    - The Android build tools should then automatically download the new Gradle tools during your first build process inside GameMaker, but please do pay attention to the whole of your compiler log if you find you have issues building in this new version
    - (Especially if you know your machine is offline or that you typically firewall GameMaker, or you use any antivirus software, as you may need to temporarily remove those restrictions on your machine and allow the Android tools to update themselves)
    - {% include important.html content="See the Required SDKs FAQ before doing any builds! You may need to update your Android Studio version (to Koala patch 2) and also install API 34 (or 35) inside Android Studio if you find you now have build errors about out-of-date Java versions or not being able to find API 34/5 tools after installing Gradle" %}

- **iOS - Support For Specifying Your Game's Supported Localisations**
    - Added support for addition of "_languagecode_.lproj" folders to the Options directory (or a config subdirectory) to allow language support to be added at the Xcode level, so that it goes through to the store listing [#5683](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5683)
    - This means that you can set the languages properly inside your project source and it will be used every build, rather than editing these values inside Xcode and then each build back in GameMaker would overwrite those Xcode changes
    - It also allows for the runner's en.lproj content to be replaced with your own custom strings
    - And fixed it so English is not listed as deprecated in the Xcode list...

- **gpu_set/get_scissor() Added**
    - Added new functions to enable setting scissor regions that will clip all rendering to the current render target and also to retrieve the position and dimensions of the current scissor region
    - Note the important info in the function list lower down this page and on the manual page for these functions

- **http_set_connect_timeout() Added**
    - Added this new function to enable setting custom timeouts to _other_ http_...() function calls [#5744](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5744)
    - Note that this timeout does not replace/affect each OS's own networking timeouts, so if you set a value that's longer than (e.g.) Ubuntu would normally wait, then the OS timeout will still happen before your custom one has a chance to

- **Additions To Debug GUI Functions**
    - dbg_button() now has the ability to show a sprite as the button [#6087](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6087)
    - dbg_drop_down() now has support for scrolling the list using mouse wheel [#6416](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6416)
    - dbg_text_separator() now has text-alignment controls [#6607](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6607)

- **Fixes/Improvements To Precise Tile-Based Collisions**
    - Fixed various issues with slopes and smooth movement in tile collisions
    - Tilemap ellipse collisions with an ellipse defined with x2<x1 and rectangle collisions with a rectangle defined with x2<x1 are now correct
    - And similarly point collisions now agree with collisions from a 1 pixel length line
    - For examples, see the two issues below:
    - Tile collision mask is not precise in 2024.6 runtimes [#6484](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6484)
    - Tile-based precise collisions against slopes are not smooth in 2024.6 [#6688](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6688)

- **Fixes/Improvements To particle_get_info()**
    - particle_get_info() now contains the information required for getting emitterIDs, which removes a number of workflow issues using other particle functions in-game
    - So you can now get your particle's info and directly pass it to these other functions - for example, something like `part_emitter_stream(sys, getInfo.emitters[0].ind, getInfo.emitters[0].parttype.ind, 1);` 
    - For more info, see the issue below:
    - particle_get_info() doesn't give a way of getting emitterIDs, causes workflow issues using other particle functions [#4904](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4904)

- **Other Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
