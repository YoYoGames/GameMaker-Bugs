## 2024.1400.4 Release (IDE 1003 / GMS2 RT 981) - [Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14.4%20closed%3A2026-02-18..2026-02-24%20sort%3Aupdated-desc) (24/02/2026)

### Features Added Or Changed

- **In-Game: [Windows] Can Now Toggle Settings Which Might Be Causing Input Lag**
    - In a previous GM release we made various changes to how swap chains are created and the flags passed to Present calls. This release adds some debug events so these settings can be toggled on and off to see if any are responsible for the input lag on some user's machines (of which we have seen many reports, including [#12980](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12980) and [#14046](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/14046) as two with lots of comments and activity).
    - These new events are used with `debug_event()` and will take effect in your game from then on
    - These debug events are:
        - "WinWaitableSwapChainOn" - enable waitable swap chains
        - "WinWaitableSwapChainOff" - disable waitable swap chains
        - "WinAllowTearingOn" - enable the 'allow tearing' flag on swap chains (for VRR displays)
        - "WinAllowTearingOff" - disable the 'allow tearing' flag.
        - "WinPresentRestartOn" - enable the DXGI_PRESENT_RESTART flag to be passed to Present
        - "WinPresentRestartOff" - disable use of the DXGI_PRESENT_RESTART flag.
        - "WinPresentDoNotWaitOn" - enable use of the DXGI_PRESENT_DO_NOT_WAIT flag to be passed to Present
        - "WinPresentDoNotWaitOff" - disable use of the DXGI_PRESENT_DO_NOT_WAIT flag.
        - Be aware that in all the above cases the default setting used in your game is "enabled".
    - In addition there is now also a commandline option to prevent raising the game process to high priority, this is "-normalprocesspriority".
    - If you currently have input lag when running games on your PC, **please** do give these a go ASAP and make sure let us know which one(s) made things better or worse for you (either on Discord or via a comment on the existing bug reports)

- **Building Projects: Alerts When Attempting A GMRT target, But GMRT Not Installed [#11017](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11017)**
    - Prior to this release, there was no guidance given at the start of the build process if you do not actually have GMRT installed and set up - the build simply failed because a file could not be found
    - Now, your build will be safely aborted and instead you will get a new dialog advising that you do not have GMRT installed and how to fix this

- **Building Projects: Extensions Now Support More Batch/Shell Scripts [#11017](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/14088)**
    - Up until this release, you could not use either of `pre_project_step.bat` or `post_project_step.bat` (or their .sh shell equivalents) in your extensions
    - Now, when your project is being built, all extensions are scanned to see if they contain these files and they will be performed if found
    - NOTE: This system cannot take into account whether an extension is actually enabled/disabled for the current build target, as the project is not loaded at this point, so if any of these files are present they will always be executed. Use responsibly!

## 2024.1400.4 Release (IDE 999 / GMS2 RT 973) - [Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14.4%20closed%3A2026-02-11..2026-02-18%20sort%3Aupdated-desc) (18/02/2026)

### Features Added Or Changed

- **Prefab Library: Multiselections Are Now Shown In Full [#13960](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13960)**
    - Previously, when you multi-selected folders in the Prefab Library tree at the left side, the right-hand panel (by design) could only show one folder at a time
    - Now, the full contents of what you have selected will be shown, giving accurate information as to what is actually being considered for importing, etc.

- **In-Game: `random_set_seed()` Allows Greater Range Of Seed Values [#3006](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3006)**
    - This function has now gained an override which will raise the number of possible RNG states
    - You simply pass in a value as a second argument, and this will perform a version of the function which no longer truncates the values
    - If you continue passing in only one argument, then this will maintain the current behaviour
    - However, be aware that HTML5 had a secondary fix to bring it more in-line with the behaviour on other platforms, even when only passing the one argument
    - More info on all of this can be found on the issue

## 2024.1400.4 Release (IDE 991 / GMS2 RT 968) - [Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14.4%20closed%3A2026-02-04..2026-02-11%20sort%3Aupdated-desc) (11/02/2026)

### Matching ProjectTool Release Required For Exporting

Be aware that the change below for the new Game Option means that you will likely need to manually get the matching ProjectTool version 2024.14.157 from `Tools > Package Manager` inside GameMaker (or any newer version released in the future).

Without this, you might be blocked from exporting your project or creating local packages, and from opening projects back in older IDEs if you need to do that.

_Future releases will come with a suitable PT version already included._

<br>

### Features Added Or Changed

- **Game Options: [Windows] Added support For Direct Polling Of Mouse Cursor Location [#13394](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13394)**
    - Added support for enabling direct polling of the mouse position, rather than relying on Windows messages in the way GameMaker has always done, to prevent instances input delay seen when toggling fullscreen/focus for you game 
    - You can see discussions of various situations when this might happen on the issue above, and from there determine if this is something your game would benefit from if you enabled the functionality

- **In-Game: [GX.games] Added Ability To Share Screenshots And URLs [#13701](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13701)**
    - You can now trigger the share dialog inside the browser and use this to send screenshots and URLs to others
    - On the issue above you can find a small example project which shows how to do this
    - More general information on browser sharing functionality can be found on [this Mozilla docs site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share)

- **In-Game: `flexpanel_node_set_measure_function()` Can Now Clear Its Bind [#13609](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13609)**
    - Added the ability to call this function and pass it "undefined" to clear any existing function that you have bound to the node

- **Prefab Library: Duplicate Entire Folders/Collections At Once [#10940](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10940)**
    - Added a right-click option when selecting a Collection or a folder within a Collection (or multiple folders at once)
    - This will then allow you to duplicate via one click everything inside whatever you had selected

<br>

<br>

### Build Bugs Fixed

- In-Game: Changing window size/state soon after earlier request no longer ignores the new request, leave window at wrong values (e.g, launch game and immediately click different app) [#12949](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12949)
- In-Game: [GX.games YYC] Fixed that JS extensions caused a startup error, "Error occured: Uncaught ReferenceError: wasm_browser_get_user_agent is not defined" [#13942](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13942)

## 2024.1400.4 Release (IDE 986 / GMS2 RT 961) - [Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14.4%20closed%3A<2026-02-04%20sort%3Aupdated-desc) (04/02/2026)

### Features Added Or Changed

- **Prefabs: Added Support For Modifying Exposed Prefab Macros [#9781](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9781)**
    - Users of prefabs can now modify any exposed macros found in that prefab
    - This uses a syntax similar to the config macros functionality that GM has supported for a long time - 
        - `#macro ::<prefab-scope>::[<ConfigName>:]<MacroName> <value>`
        - e.g., `#macro ::com.russell.macrotest-1.0.0::Release:IsDebug false` as shown in the comments on the issue above
    - See the issue and also the manual for more info

- **Target Manager: Reddit Now Appears Lower In The List [#13675](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13675)**
    - Moved the new Reddit target lower down in the targets list, so that the entry for your current OS is back nearer the top again

<br>
