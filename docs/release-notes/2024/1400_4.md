## 2024.1400.4 Release (IDE 991 / GMS2 RT 968) - [Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14.4%20closed%3A2026-02-04..2026-02-11%20sort%3Aupdated-desc) (11/02/2026)

### Matching ProjectTool Release Required For Exporting

Be aware that the change below for the new Game Option means that you will likely need to manually get the matching ProjectTool version 2024.14.157 from `Tools > Package Manager` inside GameMaker (or any newer version released in the future).

Without this, you might be blocked from exporting your project or creating local packages, and from opening projects back in older IDEs if you need to do that.

_Future releases will come with a suitable PT version already included._

<br>

### Features Added Or Changed

- **Game Options: [Windows] Added support For Direct Polling Of Mouse Cursor Location [#13394](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13394)**
    - Added support for enabling direct polling of the mouse position, rather than relying on Windows messages in the way GameMaker has always done, to prevent instances input delay seen when toggling fullscreen/focus for you game 
    - You can see discussions of various situations when this might happen on the issue above, and from there determine if this is something your game would benefit from if you enabled the functionality

- **In-Game: [GX.games] Added Ability To Share Screenshots And URLs [#13701](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13701)**
    - You can now trigger the share dialog inside the browser and use this to send screenshots and URLs to others
    - On the issue above you can find a small example project which shows how to do this
    - More general information on browser sharing functionality can be found on [this Mozilla docs site](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share)

- **In-Game: `flexpanel_node_set_measure_function()` Can Now Clear Its Bind [#13609](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13609)**
    - Added the ability to call this function and pass it "undefined" to clear any existing function that you have bound to the node

- **Prefab Library: Duplicate Entire Folders/Collections At Once [#10940](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10940)**
    - Added a right-click option when selecting a Collection or a folder within a Collection (or multiple folders at once)
    - This will then allow you to duplicate via one click everything inside whatever you had selected

<br>
