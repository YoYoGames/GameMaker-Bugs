## 2024.1400.4 Release (IDE 986 / GMS2 RT 961) - [Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14.4%20closed%3A<2026-02-04%20sort%3Aupdated-desc) (04/02/2026)

### Features Added Or Changed

- **Prefabs: Added Support For Modifying Exposed Prefab Macros [#9781](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9781)**
    - Users of prefabs can now modify any exposed macros found in that prefab
    - This uses a syntax similar to the config macros functionality that GM has supported for a long time - 
        - `#macro ::<prefab-scope>::[<ConfigName>:]<MacroName> <value>`
        - e.g., `#macro ::com.russell.macrotest-1.0.0::Release:IsDebug false` as shown in the comments on the issue above
    - See the issue and also the manual for more info

- **Target Manager: Reddit Now Appears Lower In The List [#13675](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13675)**
    - Moved the new Reddit target lower down in the targets list, so that the entry for your current OS is back nearer the top again

<br>

### Crash/Stability Fixes

- Image Editor: GM no longer crashes after undoing a change to one frame of a sprite, then using fill on a different frame (and finding instead it incorrectly pasted part of the sprite in again) [#13883](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13883)
- Image Editor: GM no longer goes unstable (and the undo action is no longer broken) after deleting frames following reordering those frames [#13117](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13117)
- Image Editor: GM no longer crashes when using the eraser tool after earlier using a hotkey to override a mouse-down when initially selecting the eraser tool [#13513](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13513)
- Project Load: GM no longer silently crashes a short while after opening the attached project [#10685](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10685)

- Prefab Library: Projects edited in one IDE install to reference a newer version of any prefab can now be opened in a different IDE which only has an older version of that prefab installed (the newer version will be found and installed automatically, and you can then remove the old version if you want) [#13739](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13739)
