# 2024.1300 - Current Version: IDE 768/Runtime 775

Download Links: [Windows](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2024.1300.0.768.exe) - [macOS](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-2024.1300.0.768.pkg) - [Ubuntu Beta](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Beta-2024.1300.0.768.deb)

{% include important.html content="GMRT Users: Please be aware these 2024.1300/2024.13 releases are incompatible with GMRT 0.14.0 and older - you will need to install newer 0.15.0+ packages in Package Manager before any projects will build using GMRT" %}

## Beta 5 - [IDE 768/Runtime 775 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.13+closed%3A2025-02-12..2025-03-05)  (Mar 06, 2025)

_Note that this is a very large release since Beta 4 and there are over 150 closed issues in the public changelist - accordingly, not everything will be listed here. Please do see the changelist above if you have specific fixes you're waiting for or need more information on why something in your project may be behaving differently as of this release._

{% include note.html content="We are aware that some projects can give a Feather LSP error notification on load in this version - e.g., the Match 3 template on the Start Page [#9653](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9653)" %}

- **UI Layers Support**
    - Building on the flexpanels feature introduced in 2024.11 runtimes, you can now create dedicated UI layers inside the Room Editor and lay out all of your assets in a visual manner
    - These layers are global and persist throughout rooms, so you only need to set up a layer once and then you can use it in whichever rooms require it
    - The layers scale to fit your game windows and because they are in UI space they will be shown above any black bar areas surrounding your game's application_surface 
    - Assets on UI Layers can then be manipulated in-game using the existing runtime functions - and a new function has been added so that you can query if a given asset is present on a UI Layer or not
    - For more information see [#3159](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3159)
    - Note that the issue above also has downloadable examples for a range of different UIs you might wish to make in your own game (front end with highlighted text, linked pause menus, settings menus, level-select screens, and more), so do check out these sample projects and see how this powerful new feature can be used

- **SVG Support Additions**
    - Added support for almost all forms of radial gradients in shapes (see the issue for one caveat) [#8276](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8276)
    - As well as this, there are a few fixes for informational/choice dialogs not being shown at the correct times when working with SVGs inside the IDE:
    - SVGs: Dialog for importing as a bitmap instead is not shown when dropping a .svg onto GameMaker [#9584](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9584)
    - Tile Set Editor: Assigning a vector sprite silently converts it to a bitmap, should show a dialog saying this will happen [#9583](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9583)

- **Create Physics Shapes At Runtime**
    - `sprite_get_convex_hull()` can now be used to generate the points of a convex hull for the given sprite
    - You supply a sprite index (which can be an asset added through the Asset Browser or a sprite added at runtime) and a precision value, and the function returns an array of reals defining the points of the convex hull
    - For more information see [#9472](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9472)

- **Game Options Default Value Changes**
    - Currently all product/display names are set as "Created in Gamemaker" which, while true, is not a great name for _your_ game.
    - This also leads to issues if you do not update this value in Game Options before releasing your content - for example, GX.Games uploads will fail as the name is already taken, and creating and running an installer on some platforms will leave it with an unhelpful folder name "Created In Gamemaker"
    - Now, it's the _initial_ name of your project that is used when creating your Game Options the first time (so if you later rename your project you should still edit these values yourself)
    - For more information see [#8291](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8291)
    - Also, be aware that the default value of Windows' "Interpolate colours between pixels" setting is now ON, so it matches what the manual has long said and is the same as all the other targets [#2343](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2343)

- **Changes To Noone Being Returned By Some Functions**
    - When reviewing the below bug report we found several other places where "noone" was being passed back as the number -4 rather than an instance handle
    - These have all been changed to return an instance reference of -4
    - This may affect any code you have in your projects where you are checking for is_number() or is_handle() rather then looking for "noone"
    - Note that most of the locations changed were to do with collision code - where noone is passed back when nothing is found
    - In-Game: layer_instance_get_instance() returns "-4" when the element is not an instance, should be an invalid instance handle ("ref instance -4") [#9374](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9374)

- **ProjectTool Updated**
    - A newer "2024.1300." version of ProjectTool was released earlier this week - this IDE uses that version; however, you may need to modify Package Manager in order to use this newer version
    - If you see any issues with importing/exporting projects or packages, check to see if you have already got a version of ProjectTool installed inside Package Manager (in the "GM Tools" list)
    - If Package Manager currently says you're using any older "0." version, then be aware it's always the one in Package Manager that will be prefered by the IDE
    - Simply uninstall that old version/update to the newer one and this will hopefully resolve the problem you're seeing

- **Bug Reporter UI Tweaks**
    - Made the private attachment section an actual boxed/grouped section so we can avoid misinterpretations [#8398](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8398)
    - Now sends the GMRT package version when submitting a GMRT Bug report, rather than sending the GMS2 runtime version (it's not marked as closed yet, as a new GMRT release is required before this will work, but the IDE change is in this release) [#8583](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8583)
    - {% include note.html content="If you're still seeing Unauthorised errors following last week's Web server changes, please sign out and in again inside GameMaker and this will likely fix straight away - [#9473](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9473)" %}

- **Code Editor 2 Fixes**
    - This is just a small and not sorted at all sample of the bigger changes or most-commonly-reported issues - again, there are a lot of other fixes for CE2 listed in the changelist, so please see the link higher up if you need information on a specific issue

## Beta 3 - [IDE 739/Runtime 749 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.13+closed%3A2025-01-29..2025-02-05)  (Feb 06, 2025)

- **Windows IDE Updater Is Now A Package**
    - Rather than shipping a fixed version of the IDE updater inside the GM installer, you will now download the latest version of the updater when first starting GM after installing it (just like how you get your runtimes at the moment)
    - The version you have installed can also now be changed inside Package Manager - so, if it is ever required to do so in order to update your current IDE install to a newer version, you could install the newest updater at that time and then restart GM to get the new version
 
- **Marketplace Integration Changed**
    - Be aware that managing your Marketplace library and also uploading new versions of your assets is all now done via your web browser, not inside GameMaker itself
    - You will find that some menu options are either removed or now just open the correct URL in your OS's default browser
    - For more, see [#9304](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9304)
 
- **Inspector Support For The "Extension Options" Panel In Extensions**
    - You can now inspect the options for your extensions
    - Only the options have been implemented, as these are the per-project settings that the _users_ of an extension will need to set quickly and easily
    - If you're the _developer_ of an extension, this also means your own values are safely still in the Extension Editor and less likely to be accidentally modified
    - For more, see [#5345](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5345)

- **Prefab Library Fixes**
    - Duplicating a prefab now puts the new assets inside a folder which has the prefab's name [#8353](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8353)
    - Asset Browser now immediately shows new assets when the Prefab Library's "Duplicate to project" operation needed to create a new group first [#8566](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8566)

- **[GX.games] Added Tilt Support**
    - Device gyro functionality is now supported on Android and iOS mobile devices
    - Be aware this is a permission you must request from the player, and so the previously Android-only `os_request_permission()` has now been extended to work on more platforms
    - For more (including a sample project showing this functionality), see [#9267](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9267)

- **[GX.games] Added Camera Support**
    - You can now capture the feed from a camera and open it with `video_open()` in your games
    - Same as the change above, be aware this is a permission you must request from the player
    - For more (including a sample project showing this functionality), see [#9229](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9229)

- **physics_debug() Added** 
    - Enables\disables physics errors which were previously being silently ignored
    - For more (including a sample project showing this functionality), see [#8997](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8997)

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Building Projects: [GX.games] Uploading a game to the GXC can fail with "Incorrect Data" message if your session token is not refreshed correctly (now, GM detects if the token failed to refresh properly and will show a message that you need to sign out and in again to fix) [#7464](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7464)
    - Code Editor: Deprecated constants for unsupported devices "os_uwp", "os_psvita", "os_ps3", "os_win8native", "os_winphone", "os_xboxone" [#9192](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9192)
    - Game Options: [iOS] Remove the check that icons need an alpha channel, as Apple no longer requires this [#9175](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9175)
    - Local Package Integration: Cannot create working packages [#9305](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9305)
    - Project Health: SVG images give report each project load that layers are missing for that sprite [#9202](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9202)
    - Project Load: If one project fails and then a second one loads correctly, the menu/tool bars disable lots of items [#8340](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8340)
    - UI/UX: [Windows] Win-V does not paste any text from the clipboard in 2024.13 Betas [#9178](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9178)

- **Other Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - In-Game: Debug runs crash in the attached project when using 2024.11.0.227 runtime #9245](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9245)
    - In-Game: Silent crash due to "b2ParticleSystem::DestroyParticle(int, bool)" after destroying a particle [#8997](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8997)
    - In-Game: [HTML5] array_find_index() uses incorrect argument values and errors accordingly [#9200](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9200)
    - In-Game: debug_event("ResourceCounts") should include vertex buffers [#9170](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9170)
    - In-Game: [HTML5] instance_place() and other related collision functions do not return "noone" when no collisions are found for their array argument [#9222](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9222)
    - In-Game: layer_get_id_at_depth() returns array "-1" instead of an array with the handle "ref layer -1" [#9214](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9214)
    - In-Game: layer_get_script_begin() and layer_get_script_end() return "-1" instead of the handle "ref script -1" [#9212](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9212)
    - In-Game: object_get_mask() returns "-1" instead of the handle "ref sprite -1" [#9206](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9206)
    - In-Game: object_get_sprite() returns "-1" instead of the handle "ref sprite -1" [#9206](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9206)
    - In-Game: os_request_permission() has now been extended to work on more platforms as a result of the GX.games features mentioned above

## Beta 2 - [IDE 732/Runtime 743 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.13+closed%3A2025-01-16..2025-01-28)  (Jan 29, 2025)

- **"Downloading The Matching Runtime" Fixes**
    - The previous Beta had an issue where any runtimes created after the year 2024 might not be considered properly when checking for available newer versions
    - Also, for anyone who has a secondary runtime feed set in Preferences this also could have caused a failure to download the matching runtime after updating to a new IDE
    - You should find the IDE will again now reliably download its matching runtime after installing a new IDE version

- **"Project Health" Checks For Missing Sprites In Your Project**
    - Added a dialog to warn when GameMaker finds a Sprite's source images have been removed on disk, but the Sprite is still in the Asset Browser and part of your project
    - This has always appeared as a red X image inside GameMaker, but this quiet warning could lead to confusion where in-game you might not easily realise why a sprite is not being drawn - now, you will be much more clearly advised when opening the project exactly which files are missing
    - Note that it's only Sprites which are checked in this way
    - For more, see [#6749](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6749)

- **Code Editor 2 Fixes**
    - Again, lots of fixes for things such as region folding not working corectly, auto-indentation still either adding too many or too few indents, struct literals breaking further code-colouring, autocomplete leaving the caret in the wrong place, and lots of fixes in Preferences for theme editor issues
    - See the changelist for all the details, as there are far too many reports fixed already to list individually here, but there are a few to be aware of:
    - Code Editor 2: Text selection colour is fully opaque in 2024.1300 Beta 1 [#9048](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9048) - be aware that for this one you need to click the Restore Defaults button for the theme in Preferences before you will see this fix
    - Code Editor 2: GM unstable when scrolling the events for certain Objects in the Scrolling Shooter template [#9039](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9039)
    - Code Editor 2: Changes aren't auto-saved when you switch to another object [#8880](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8880)

- **Additions to SVG support**
    - Added support for stroke outlines for shapes [#8275](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8275)
    - Added support for standalone line and polyline elements [#8274](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8274)
    - For more, see those two issues above, as there are some parts of these features still unsupported, which wil stop some images being supported

- **Strings for handles to an asset now use the name of the asset rather than the number**
    - This is a change primarily because the name is stable between versions, when the ID number is not; however, it is also now much easier to read the strings and know which asset is being referred-to
    - For more, see [#9053](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9053)

- **"GM_runtime_type" added**
    - Added a new constant for determining if a game was built with the GMS2 runtimes or GMRT
    - For more, see [#9055](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9055)

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**

    - Project Load: Does not warn correctly when finding a sprite that has been removed from the project [#6749](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6749)
    - Sprite Editor: ToggleCollisionTypeOptions() errors can cause the editor window to fail to open [#8953](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8953)

- **Other Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Building Projects: [YYC] Calls to a function that returns the current "self", "other" and "global" should be optimised out [#9163](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9163)
    - Building Projects: [YYC] Adding a variable into the "global" struct and then changing its value inside a with(global) block causes a fail in 2024.1300 [#9109](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9109)
    - In-Game: Video playback is not always at the correct framerate in 2024.11 runtimes [#8815](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8815)
    - In-Game: Video playback can start a few seconds ahead of expected in 2024.11 runtimes [#8936](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8936)
    - In Game: [Windows] MP4 videos no longer play on Steam Deck in 2024.11 runtimes [#8450](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8450)
    - In-Game: [YYC] Methods which return "self", when called directly after constructor instantiation, cause the constructor to be re-instantiated [#9030](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9030)
    - In-Game: [YYC] Null-coalescing operator on a struct variable that does not exist causes a crash in 2024.11 runtimes [#9126](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9126)

    - In-Game: part_particles_create_color() does not apply the new colour until part_system_update() is next called [#9070](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9070)
    - In-Game: particle_get_info() does not provide the correct ID for using with functions such as part_emitter_region() [#8845](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8845)
    - In-Game: room_next() and room_previous() return "-1" instead of the handle "ref room -1" [#9057](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9057)

## Beta 1 - [IDE 720/Runtime 733 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.13+closed%3A<2025-01-16)  (Jan 16, 2025)

- **Startup Changes To When The Matching Runtime Is Required**
    - Going forward, GameMaker will no longer force installing the matching runtime for an IDE release if a newer runtime is active and which matches at least the first 2 parts of the version number, but has a higher third/fourth part
    - This means if you install this GameMaker IDE and allow it to get its matching runtime 730, whenever we release a newer 2024.1300.0.731+ runtime you could install that one and set it active instead, then (if you wished) delete runtime 730 manually to save disk space
    - Again, to be clear, the newer runtime must be from the same "family" as the IDE version - having a "2024.1400" runtime (or whatever) will still not be accepted by this 2024.1300 IDE and it would download its matching runtime again for you
    - For more, see [#5927](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5927)

- **Code Editor 2 Fixes**
    - Lots of fixes for code-folding, auto-indentation either adding too many or too few indents, autocomplete not appearing/closing reliably as you type, or autocomplete adding unwanted extra # characters when you already typed the # yourself
    - See the changelist for all the details, as there are far too many reports fixed already to list individually here
    - Code Editor 2: Add a Preference for Ctrl+K to always add comment characters at the start of the top line, not at current selection location [#8869](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8869)

- **"Remove Unused Assets" Fixes For When Building Projects**
    - Lots of fixes for incorrect checks when something is still required, plus a number of ways in which debug runs (specifically) would give a silent crash or close rather than showing you a suitable code error first. 
    - See the changelist for all the details, as there are too many reports fixed already to list individually here

- **gml_pragma() Support For Always Compiling Assets With Your Specified Tags**
    - Added a new "MarkTagAsUsed" command to say certain tags already added to your assets in the IDE denote that these assets must always be built, even when the Game Option for removing unused assets is ON
    - As an example, if I have an IDE tag called "AlwaysCompileMe" and I have assigned that to some assets, I could type : `gml_pragma("MarkTagAsUsed", "AlwaysCompileMe");`
    - For more, see [#8313](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8313)

- **Android - Change To Minimum Game Options Values During Builds**
    - {% include important.html content="The 'Compile SDK' minimum value is now 34 - anything lower than this will cause your build to fail with a suitable message why" %}
    - Please do check this is correct when opening/building existing projects created in older IDEs!

- **Android - Support For Controlling Gradle Versions And New Graphics Settings**
    - The Gradle Version and Gradle Plugin Version required during a build are now editable by you and can be set per-project - there are new text fields in Game Options->Android->General for this
    - You can now enable Edge-to-Edge display and also allow control of the display layout via new settings in Game Options->Android->Graphics
    - For more (including a sample project showing this functionality), see [#8186](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8186)

- **Android & iOS - New Async Event When Layout Changes**
    - A new Async System message is sent when the display layout changes
    - This event is of type "DisplayLayoutInfo" and contains "safeinsettop", "safeinsetbottom", "safeinsetleft" and "safeinsetright" - which return the distance from that edge that it is safe to display in (i.e. where no system UI will cover it)
    - On Android only, the event also returns a "boundrects" entry that contains information on rectangles within those areas that are non-functional (Display Cutout)
    - If the display layout has a waterfall display, then this is also returned as "waterfallinsetbottom"/"waterfallinsettop"/"waterfallinsetleft"/"waterfallinsetright"
    - For more (including a sample project showing this functionality), see the same [#8186](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8186) mentioned in the section above

- **handle_parse() Changes/Fixes**
    - This function now allows passing in your asset/function names (and) as part of the string rather than typing numbers in [#9020](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9020)
    - It also now supports GameMaker's built-in function names [#9021](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9021)
    - For invalid handles, it also now returns either "undefined" or "ref -1", depending on how/why the handle is invalid [#8957](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8957)

- **tvOS Better Support For Siri Remotes**
    - You can now use newer remote versions and also get their gyro inputs - see the following two issues for a little more info:
    - In-Game: [tvOS] Add support for Siri Remote 2+ [#4254](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4254)
    - In-Game: [tvOS] Add support for the motion controls in the Siri Remote [#3959](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3959)

- **Building Projects: Add support for calling batch files during a Clean operation**
    - You can now create your own batch and shell scripts for pre_clean_step.bat (or pre_clean_step.sh) AND post_clean_step.bat (or post_clean_step.sh)
    - These pre-post scripts can also be added to your extensions to add similar functionality there
    - For more, see [#8695](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8695)

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**

    - Sound Editor: GameMaker doesn't play an audio file from Audacity [#880](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/880)
    - {% include important.html content="Note that Ubuntu IDE users still on Ubuntu 22 need to ensure they've already updated to using FFMpeg 6 (as has been required for several GM releases already) - see the issue above for more info" %}
