[Click here to see all of the 2024.14 point release notes, so you know what's in each version](\release-notes\2024\14)

2024.14.1 builds on the original .0 release to bring more of the features and improvements targeted ahead of LTS 2026.

Note that this release does change quite a few important bits of functionality, so please do read the release notes carefully: Logins have changed to a more reliable newer system, and the UI for this has had a refresh also; GameMaker is now better at informing you/us when there has been a crash or it has gone unstable (so you *may* see more requests to send us a crash report); and GameMaker is also now better at catching a number of coding mistakes in your projects (so you *may* see more Code Error dialogs when testing your game).

{% include important.html content="As mentioned in 2024.14.0's notes, the IDE updater in 2024.13-and-older releases cannot update you to 2024.14 - you will need to download the installer using the links above and install again (if you're not a Steam user, which will of course update you as per usual)." %}

### Features Added Or Changed

- **New Login Flow**
    - Signing-in has always had different UI depending on whether you have an old "Legacy" account or a newer Opera SSO Account
    - Now, the "Legacy" UI has been removed from inside GameMaker and instead _all_ users will sign-in via the one button, which will open your web browser and allow you to sign-in there - once on the website, you will find the new Legacy option alongside the existing SSO one
    - Proxy server users: Be aware this release also moves the controls for saying whether you have a proxy server and which details you log in with, so you will now find these in Preferences > General Settings > Proxy Settings. (Any proxy values have always applied to all internet traffic, including to SSO sign-ins, so this should clear up any confusion.)
    - {% include important.html content="Due to this change of licensing system, you will be asked to log in again the first time you start this IDE (if you're coming from an older GM release). Similarly, if you want to use older IDEs/runtimes again in future, then you will need to delete your um.json file manually and log in again when first starting that old IDE. You cannot use older runtimes with this 2024.14.1 IDE, as they will result in an unable to obtain permission error." %}

- **Filters/Effects And SDF Support Are Now Prefabs**
    - These items are no longer always part of the runner/your build and instead are added dynamically if your project requires them
    - That does mean that if you try to build a project which uses this functionality and you have not already linked the prefab to the project, then you will get a compile fail asking you to fix this / a dialog saying GameMaker fixed it for you
    - Once you have linked any missing prefab(s), GameMaker will normally retry the build automatically, but if it does not start it again immediately, just build your project again - and that's that project sorted thereafter
    - Note: this process will be streamlined throughout the rest of 2024.1400/14 development to automate more of it for you and show fewer fails/dialogs, but in this first release you will need to accept any dialogs or double-click any errors yourself to quickly install or link the missing prefab(s)

- **GM Now Creates Crash Dumps Even When It Recovers Enough To Close Itself Down [#11710](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11710)**
    - It was realised that in some cases where GM told you there was a problem and so it had to close, because it was able to close safely it didn't then create a crash dump or ask you to send anything to us so we would know about that problem and be able to fix it
    - Now, the cmd window will briefly appear when GM closes down due to one of these errors and the crash reporter will appear the next time you start GM again

- **"Build" Folder Added To Seed .gitignore Files [#6976](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6976)**
    - Added a new entry into the auto-generated .gitignore file that GameMaker makes when you create new projects, so that the GMRT build folder is ignored by your git client
    - For users with existing projects, if you want to see how to make this same change retroactively, see the issue link above

- **Code Editor 2: Added Support For Previewing Prefab Object Event Code [#12851](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12851)**
    - It's now possible for code written in a prefab Object to be previewed in a read-only mode
    - Select the Object in your prefab library and this will open it in the Inspector and show you the events that Object contains, and then you can now double-click the event in order to see its code

- **Device Manager: [iOS] Added support for a dummy device to be selected in Target Manager and used when building for iOS [#8413](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8413)**
    - Similar to how XCode allows you to build for "Any IOS Device", which can then be deployed via Testflight or to a real device later on, GameMaker now has a default/dummy iOS device in Target Manager that you can use and do iOS builds even when no real iPhone/iPad is connected to your Mac (this is particularly useful in the case of remote or CI build setups)
    - As you can see below, there have also been fixes for iOS and tvOS physical devices not being detected on some newer Mac hardware setups

- **GX.games: Removed "QR" and "Console" buttons from exported packages [#12183](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12183)**
    - These buttons are now removed when exporting using the Create Exe options
    - They do still appear for run/debug, as you'd expect

- **In-Game: New Add/Delete Functions For Spawning Particle Systems Created In The IDE With Customised Values [#12150](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12150)**
    - A new function has been added which can take edited values for a particle system emitter already created in the IDE and create a new instance of that system which uses the new values
    - Also, a matching function to delete the system when you're done with it

- **In-Game: debug_event("ErrorOnWarning") Turns Warnings Into Code Error Dialogs Which Include A Callstack [#4118](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4118)**
    - In older runtime versions you would simply get a debug warning for a number of coding errors and there was no real information on how this problem had been encountered/where to look in your code in order tom go about fixing it
    - As some examples given on the issue, this is messages like "Grid Index Writing Out Of Bounds", "Error: Index did not map to an existing audio asset" which show up in your Output window
    - Now, you can call `debug_event("ErrorOnWarning")` somewhere early in your game and this will change all of these warnings into you being shown a code error dialog - at which point, you're now also shown a small callstack to help work out the steps that led up to this error being encountered
    - Note that there were several other old requests for this, so those have been marked as duplicates of #4118 and closed now

- **In-Game: instance_create_...() Now Allows "undefined" For Its Optional var_struct Parameter [#12218](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12218)**
    - The functions will now work if undefined is passed in as the optional `var_struct` parameter, using an empty struct as expected

- **PlayStation 5: Updated  to 12.00 [#12361](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12361)**
    - You will need to update your install to this same version, otherwise builds will fail
    - See the console's wiki if you need further info

### Crash/Stability Fixes

- Object Editor: Fixed GM unstable when trying to undo the deletion of a Variable Definition that has been overwritten in a child Object [#12297](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12297)
- Project Load/Save: Attempted fix and also a lot more logging for GM 2024.14 crash when loading projects containing sounds/importing new sounds on my PC [#12485](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12485)

- Also, more error-logging has been added for the below crashes that were reported recently but were not able to be reproduced (and look to be the result of an attempted update from .13. to .14 using the IDE updater, followed by running the installer over the top). If you reported one of those to us and you still have the issue in this new version, first of all please uninstall GameMaker and then reinstall using the full installer for this release (linked above) and then, if that still fails to fix it, file a new bug report and ensure your ui.log reaches us, please
