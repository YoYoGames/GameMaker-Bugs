## Beta 1 - [IDE 79/Runtime 79 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A<2025-04-24%20)  (Apr 24, 2025)

- **IDE Updater: Mac IDE Supported**
    - Mac IDE users can now see and take advantage of the new updates process that's been available on Windows for the last few releases
    - You will now get the newer-style updater notifcations and the installer will be downloaded in the background as you use GameMaker
    - Your IDE installation will then be updated on restarting from the dialog/the next time GameMaker is started
    - For more on this IDE updater process, see the manual

- **Fixed Lauching GM Via Opening Your Project**
    - Fixed an issue where double-clicking a .yyp file to launch GM could open an empty/blank and unusable GameMaker window on some people's machines
    - For more, see [#10309](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10309) - note that we had a lot of duplicate reports for this one, so you can consider everyone's reports fixed

- **IDE Now Advises On Startup If YYAL Failed To Load**
    - Fixed an issue on Windows/Mac/Ubuntu where GM would crash on startup when YYAL fails to load for any reason
    - Now, you will get a warning message advising you that this problem happened and a little hint to chekc your ui.log for any information why and potentially how to fix
    - As this new dialog says, in these situations you can still start GameMaker and edit your project okay, but audio previews will not work in the Sound Editor
    - For more, see [#10222](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10222)
    - Note that this is ultimately why Ubuntu 22 (and various other unsupported distros) stopped working as of 2024.1300 Beta 5, so you may well find GM now launches on those distros again, just with no sound support
    - However, Ubuntu 22 is still classed as unsupported since 2024.13

- **Fixed UI Layer Drawing On Room Change/Restart**
    - Fixed an issue found in the 2023.13 runtimes where the drawing of elements on the same UI Layer is flipped after changing to a different room
    - This was most-commonly seen when using our blog post's sample game project and its Esc menu's text/button draw order would change
    - For more, see [#10311](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10311) - again, lots of duplicates for this one, so consider all reports fixed

- **GX.games Now Supports Transparent Backgrounds**
    - In-Game: [GX.games] Add support for rendering with a transparent background
    - For more, see [#10305](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10305)
