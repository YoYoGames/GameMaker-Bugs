## Beta 4 - [IDE 826/Runtime 822 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A2025-05-29..2025-06-10)  (June 11, 2025)

 - **Windows IDE Updater Updated**
    - Named the executable something safer-sounding and identifiable as a GameMaker tool than the old name of "WindowsAutoUpdater"
    - Note that the updater which is included in this release has the old name, but right now you have the choice to install the new updater manually from Package Manager
    - However, the next Beta will therefore include a version of the IDE updater which does have the new name
    - FOr a little more, see [#10805](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10805)

 - **Room Editor: Able To Modify Flexpanels With Your Mouse**
    - Added the ability into the UI Layers functionality for resizing Flexpanels via mouse
    - This support covers canvas resizing, reordering, and margin/padding adjustment
    - For more, see [#9699](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9699)

 - **Even More `texturegroup_...()` Changes**
    - Added `texturegroup_delete()` to match the new `texturegroup_add()` already added in 2024.14 [#10678](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10678)
    - Plus `texturegroup_exists()` for checking whether a specified texture group exists or not [#10919](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10919)
    - Also fixed that `texturegroup_add()` allowed multiple texture groups to be added with the same name [#10921](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10921)

 - **`array_push()` Changes**
    - This function now behaves like the array is a growable list

    - Game Options: No asset_layout_info.json is generated by the TextureCompression sample [#10896](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10896)
    - Inspector: [Layers] Double-clicking an instance focuses on the wrong location if previous location being viewed is far away [#2462](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2462)
    - Room Editor: Creation Code window does not reliably appear on first click it, can also open at offset location [#10950](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10950)
    - Room Editor: Creating a flexpanel ignores any existing/selected UI Layers and creates a new Layer instead [#10810](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10810)
    - Room Editor: Fixed issues with DPI being used on fonts for text elements [#10885](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10885)
    - UI/UX: Code Editor 1's shortcuts do not load if the custom user snippets file contains a duplicate of a default snippet [#10843](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10843)

- **Other Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Garbage Collection: [YYC] Access violation when MarkAndSweepGen() is called just after an if block referencing g_IgnoreGen [#10908](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/))
    - In-Game: Moving between persistent rooms with UI prevents moving back to already seen room [#10891](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10891) / In-Game: Game drawing does not update after changing between persistent rooms [#10870](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10870)

## Beta 3 - [IDE 815/Runtime 815 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A2025-05-17..2025-05-28)  (May 20, 2025)

 - **ProjectTool Updated Again**
    - A 2024.14.131 release has now been set live for supporting the Sound Editor/Inspector change below, plus some of the other changes
    - As this is a change to saving/loading assets, please ensure you're set as using this version in Package Manager

- **Xbox XDK Version Updated**
    - If you're an Xbox developer, then be aware you will need to use a newer XDK version as of this GameMaker release
    - Please see the setup wiki page for the specifics
    - {% include important.html content="Please ensure you're using the correct XDK version _and_ you have updated your console firmware to match, clean your cache and then try building again before you submit any bugs!" %}

- **Room Editor Performance Fixes**
    - Fixed a longstanding issue which caused performance problems when editing tile layers in your rooms
    - Now, in most cases you will not see any delays, but be aware of you are selecting and copy/pasting hundreds of tiles at once there is still some lag - which will be fixed for a separate bug report
    - For more, see #10710 (and there were several older/newer duplicates of this one, so all have been closed by this fix)
    - Also addressed the followinmg issues:
    - Room Editor: Please Speed Up Room Editing [#10670](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10670)
    - Room Editor: Performance worsens as more instances are added to a layer [#10088](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10088)
    - Room Editor: Copy-and-pasting assets is extremely slow on large projects [#7653](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7653)
    - And this one actually crept into Beta 2 unannounced and seems to be working fine according to the recent comments (thanks!):
    - Room Editor: Copy-and-pasting assets is extremely slow on large projects [#7653](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7653)

- **Sound Editor/Inspector Improved clarity Of Editor Options**
    - A number of the settings shown for sounds have now been renamed so they're clearer about what they will result in
    - At the same time, several of them have been reordered/collapsed into dropdowns rather than radioboxes, and also settings that are made redundant by others are now enabled/disabled accordingly
    - There is also a new section for showing the output size of your sound, based on the settings you have currently chosen - and this information can be collapsed/expanded and even copied to the clipboard for use elsewhere
    - All of this does mean that if you change the audio file used by a sound, or you pick a new setting which would make a material difference to its output, the sound will be processed immediately and all of the values will be updated with the new results
    - Depending on the size of the audio file, this can obviously take a few seconds, and so you will see the values blank out and a spinner appears while the sound file is being built
    - Also, if your Sound is missing a source audio file the info box will make this much clearer now
    - For more and a small sample project to see the new changes in action, see [#9640](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9640)
    - Note that this change also fixes a few issues when loading Sound assets in projects:
    - Inspector: [Sound] Previewing very short audio files often does not set the button states correctly [#10256](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10256)
    - Project Save: GM crash in ConvertAudio when converting a large number of files dragged onto the IDE at the same time [#10602](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10602)
    - Project Load: Crash during ConvertAudio stops my project from loading [#10608](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10608)
    - Stability: PurgeAudio crash due to file lock [#10445](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10445)

- **Fix For Code Editor 1 Hotkeys Not Working**
    - Further to the non-QWERTY keyboard fixes in the last release, it became clear that a number of the reports were actually for CE1 specifically and hotkeys not working
    - This turned out to be the use of custom code snippets and a problem when declaring them, so those users seeing keyboard issues actually had duplicate entries and so the hotkey was being reused- this then caused an error which stopped all remaining hotkeys from being loaded
    - Now, all default hotkeys are loaded and _then_ the custom ones, with new logging and an error dialog shown if your snippets file contains this problem
    - For more, see [#10843](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10843)

- **Code Editor 2 Fixes**
    - There are a number of fixes in this release, so please do see the changelist for specifics and to learn about how the changes have been implemented

- **More Ways To Manage Texture Pages**
    - Game Options will now export your texture pages' .json files when clicking the Preview button, so this information can be edited manually (if you wish) and ultimately used in-game later on [#10735](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10735)
    - Added a `texturegroup_delete()` to match the new `texturegroup_add()` added in Beta 2 [#10678](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10678)

- **Audio Error Suppression Now Expanded To Account For Coding Problems Also**
    - Audio errors have always been shown when the game legitimately fails to find a source file (such as having newlines in the string used as the filename and passing this string to `audio_create_stream()`)
    - Now, these can be supressed by the two existing methods for "hiding" audio errors in the output log only
    - For more, see [#10198](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10198)

- **`draw_get_circle_precision()` Added**
    - "Added" this function (it was actually added several releases ago, but not shown correctly in autocomplete, etc.)
    - Can be used to get back values set by `draw_set_circle_precision()`
    - For a tiny bit more, see [#3002](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3002)

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Code Editor 2: GM unstable when changing a collision event between parent/child objects [#10700](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10700)

    - Preferences: "Path to GMRT" points to Monthly folder in 2024.1400 Beta 2 [#10743](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10743)
    - Room Editor: UI Layers should not require mouseover to see whether they are visible [#10780](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10780)
    - Room Editor: Precision errors when scaling down Sprites [#10795](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10795)
    - Room Editor: Pressing F2 after selecting a non-UI layer instance from the instance list tries to rename the room tab instead of the instance [#10703](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10703)
    - UI/UX: Clicking on and off a text box causes the caret speed to increase rapidly [#10701](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10701)

- **Other GMS2 Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Building Projects: Struct literals containing keys that have as asterisk as the name cause compile fails [#10718](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10718)
    - Building Projects: [GX.games] Igor fails when trying to build dynamic textures with a subfolder specified [#10699](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10699)
    - In-Game: Closing any game will output DestroyDsMap warnings in 2024.1400 Beta 2 [#10812](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10812)
    - In-Game: Inserting a flex panel into a UI layer with no existing flex panels causes a Microsoft C++ runtime error [#10789](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10789)
    - In-Game: Physics collisions between two infinite mass objects can generate an infinite velocity and cause an infinite loop (now, the inifite velocity will not be generated, but you might still need to review your code) [#10716](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10716)
    - In-Game: [YYC] "other" in a script function stored in an instance variable is treated as a method, results in wrong instance used [#10625](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10625)
    - In-Game: [HTML5] Mouse Pressed and Released events are not working in 2024.1400 Betas [#10717](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10717)

## Beta 2 - [IDE 808/Runtime 810 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A2025-04-29..2025-05-16)  (May 20, 2025)

- {% include important.html content="We are aware already that Mouse Pressed and Released events are not working correctly for HTML5 in this release - [#10717](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10717)" %}

- **IDE Updater: Mac IDE Updates As Of This Release**
    - Mac IDE users will now see the newer-style update notifications appearing over the Start Page and you can download the installer while you work, apply it when you're ready, etc.

 - **ProjectTool Updated**
    - A 2024.14.129 version of ProjectTool has also been released in preparation for this Beta release
    - You will need to install this version in order to be able to use the new Game Option for position_change(), plus some of the other additions in this release
    - Note that as of this Beta release and ProjectTool combination, a number of changes have been made to make ProjectTool more reliable and so you should a) be more reliably able to downgrade projects for use in older IDEs/runtimes, and b) no longer need to update your ProjectTool install alongside every Beta IDE/GMS2/GMRT release unless we actually introduce a change to assets
    - {% include important.html content="If you have any issues opening/importing projects or packages, please ensure you're using this version (or newer) of ProjectTool inside Package Manager and then try again before you submit any bugs!" %}

- **Fixes For Non-QWERTY Keyboards / Numpad When NumLock Is Off**
    - Fixed a number of issues which appeared only when using a Keyboard layout other than QWERTY, or when using a full-size keyboard which has a numberpad and Num Lock was OFF
    - UI/UX: Numpad keys are not obeyed correctly in 2024.13 IDEs when Num Lock is OFF [#10327](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10327)
    - UI/UX: Shortcuts not working properly on QWERTZ keyboards in 2024.13 IDEs [#10217](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10217)
    - UI/UX: Shortcuts not working properly on AZERTY keyboards in 2024.13 IDEs [#10154](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10154)
    - UI/UX: Shortcuts not working properly on Dvorak keyboards in 2024.13 IDEs [#10207](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10207)
    - UI/UX: Numpad Enter is not recognised in .1300 IDEs in CE2, among others [#9190](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9190)
    - Code Editor 1: "GoTo Line" dialog no longer accepts numpad Enter key as confirmation in 2024.13 [#10304](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10304)
    - And a large stack of duplicate reports for each of them - all of which are fixed due to the ones named above

- **Project Health Tool Now Warns For More Types Of Asset Problems**
    - Added warnings for Sounds that are missing their audio file [#9567](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9567)
    - Added warnings for Shaders that are missing either of their vertex/fragment shader files [#9568](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9568)
    - Also fixed that Project Health incorrectly reported files were missing for Sprite Layer Groups in 2024.13 [#9840](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9840)

- **Creating New Assets Now Uses Your Feather Preferences For Naming Conventions (Fixes)**
    - The remaining asset types are now supported also (Notes, Extensions, etc.) - however, their Preferences defaults are intentionally different to all the others, as in many cases you might not want these asset types to confirm to fixed names, etc.
    - For more, see [#10477](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10477)

- **Igor/Asset Compiler: More Errors Highlighted During Builds**
    - A number of errors and warnings that these two tools wrote to your Output window log were not using the correct formatting to make the IDE also show the lines in the Compiler Errors panel for ease of finding them later
    - Now, these loggging messages have all been standardised and will now show up correctly
    - This may of course mean that an error you never knew you had is suddenly showing - this is correct and something for you to rectify in your project or tools setup
    - Additionally, if you are using any form of build automation you may need to account for seeing these errors / change any code you had that detected the old error messages
    - For a little more, see [#10654](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10654)

- **Package Manager: Installation Cache Is No Longer Shared Between Monthly And Beta IDEs**
    - In previous releases if you downloaded a package/prefab in either of your Beta/Monthly installs, then it would immediately appear in the other one as if it was also installed and ready for use
    - In the case of Prefabs, this could cause problems where you're told that you do not have a Prefab installed, but visually you appear to have it already
    - This has now been changed so that Package Manager has a separate cache per GM IDE type, and so you will know when a Prefab is/isn't ready in whichever IDE you're currently using
    - For more on this change, see [#10130](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10130)
    - As one example of this problem in past releases, see [#10533](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10533)

- **Package Manager: Added A Preference For Your Default Scope When Opening**
    - The default scope shown in the dropdown when opening Package Manager is now "GM Tools", not "GMRT Beta"
    - However, there is also now a Preference added so you can set this to a scope value of your choice if "GM Tools" is not the one you need most often
    - For more, see [#10298](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10298)

- **Debug Overlay Now Supports Gamepad Control**
    - Added gamepad support into the debug GUI overlays in-game, so now you can interact with a pad as well
    - For more, see [#10572](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10572)

- **Can Now Create Texturepages (And Sprites) At Runtime**
    - Added the ability to create a texturegroup and sprites at runtime from an external sprite sheet
    - `texturegroup_add()` can now be used to create your texturepage and have it ready for loading when you need it
    - `texturegroup_load()` and `texturegroup_unload()` can then be used to manage that
    - For more and a sample project, see [#10367](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10367)

- **`instance_activate/deactivate_region()` Support Excluding/Targeting UI Layers**
    - Added the ability for these two functions to say whether you want to exlude things which are only on a UI Layer when managing the given region
    - For more, see [#10215](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10215)

- **`position_change()` Now Deprecated In Same Manner As `instance_change()`**
    - 2024/13 added `instance_change()` as part of the depracted functions list you have to enable in Game Options > Main if you want to still use them
    - This release sees the similar-usecase `position_change()` added as part of that same checkbox inside Game Options
    - {% include important.html content="If your project uses this function you **will** need to tick this Game Option now, otherwise you will get a code error in-game that it could not be found" %}
    - For a little more, see [#10514](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10514)

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**

## Beta 1 - [IDE 795/Runtime 802 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A<2025-04-29)  (Apr 29, 2025)

- **IDE Updater: Mac IDE Supported**
    - Although you won't actually see any evidence of this until whenever Beta 2 is released, Mac IDE users can now see and take advantage of the new updates process that's been available on Windows for the last few GameMaker versions
    - You will now get the newer-style updater notifcations and the installer will be downloaded in the background as you use GameMaker
    - Your IDE installation will then be updated on restarting from the dialog/the next time GameMaker is started
    - (Note that of course 2024.13 does not have support for the updater on Mac, so the next Monthly and LTS releases will not show/use the newer updater - it would take over when we release _the one after that_)
    - For more on this IDE updater process, see the manual and also [#10391](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10391)

 - **ProjectTool Updated**
    - A 2024.14.124 version of ProjectTool has also been released in preparation for 2024.1400 Beta 1
    - You will need to install this version in order to be able to use the new Game Option for instance_change(), plus some of the other additions in this release
    - {% include important.html content="If you have any issues opening/importing projects or packages, please ensure you're using this version (or newer) of ProjectTool inside Package Manager and then try again before you submit any bugs!" %}

- **Better DPI Support In The IDE**
    - This release sees the start of a number of improvements to DPI-handling throughout the IDE, especially when moving GameMaker between monitors
    - For more, see [#3196](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3196)
    - Note that there are a number of known issues already reported for button/checkbox sizes now being slightly too large and/or positions being slightly incorrect, so please do check for an existing report before filing minor issues like this
    - However, if you find a serious issue with this functionality that you did not have in 2024.13 (e.g. startup DPI being wildly wrong or moving GameMaker between monitors causes problems), then of course do report these urgently - or comment on any existing issues to say you have the same (send us your Upload a Bug/Sample Package link in your comment)

- **Fixed Lauching GM Via Opening Your Project**
    - Fixed an issue where double-clicking a .yyp file to launch GM could open an empty/blank and unusable GameMaker window on some people's machines
    - For more, see [#10309](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10309) - note that we had a lot of duplicate reports for this one, so you can consider everyone's reports fixed

- **Creating New Projects No Longer Adds The Empty Default Groups In The Asset Browser**
    - Changed the default value for the "Create default groups in new projects" Preference to be OFF, so that the Asset Browser is back to containing only the content that _you_ have created
    - Which means that when creating new projects you will only see the default Room1 that GameMaker always creates for you
    - This communicates more clearly to everyone new to GameMaker that you do not have to create all your sprites in the "Sprites" group, all objects in the "Objects" group, and so on...
    - It does not change the project structure when it's saved out - just that the Asset Browser won't show these unused folders
    - For more, see [#9731](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9731)
    - {% include note.html content="For existing users/GameMaker installations you may need to change the Preference yourself if you want to get this change, as this release will not modify your current Preferences value" %} 

- **Creating New Assets Now Uses Your Feather Preferences For Naming Conventions**
    - Asset Browser has been changed so that now your initial asset names will use the naming values set in your Preferences for Feather
    - This will only take effect if Feather's "Message Severity" value for rule 2017 is _not_ using the default value of "Ignore" (so you may need to change this in Preferences yourself if you want to use this functionality now)
    - For more, see [#10477](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10477)
    - _Note that in Beta 1 this is only a partial implementation and the issue has been reopened for fixes already, but still calling this out as you might see your assets using these new names and wonder why_

- **IDE Now Advises On Startup If YYAL Failed To Load**
    - Fixed an issue on Windows/Mac/Ubuntu where GM would crash on startup when YYAL fails to load for any reason
    - Now, you will get a warning message advising you that this problem happened and a little hint to check your ui.log for any information why and potentially how to fix
    - As this new dialog says, in these situations you can still start GameMaker and edit your project okay, but audio previews will not work in the Sound Editor
    - For more, see [#10222](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10222)
    - Note that this is ultimately why Ubuntu 22 (and various other unsupported distros) stopped working as of 2024.1300 Beta 5, so you may well find GM now launches on those distros again, just with no sound support
    - However, Ubuntu 22 is still classed as unsupported since 2024.13

- **Previewing Sounds In The IDE Is More Accurate**
    - Previewing a sound in the Sound Editor or Inspector now reflects the current Sound Editor settings for that asset
    - This means your options can be heard during the preview inside the IDE and you no longer have to build your game in order to hear the difference after making a change
    - Be aware that this does mean when you're editing the properties of your Sound assets you may trigger that sound to be converted on-demand, so bear in mind that this might cause short delays as this happens  
    - For more, see [#8632](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8632)
    - Be aware also that the UI/UX of many of these Sound Editor/Inspector settings will also be updated in a future 2024.1400 Beta: [#9640](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9640)

- **Output Paths For Streamed Sounds And Audio Groups**
    - Added the ability to specify a path for storing streamed audio files, so they are not in the root folder
    - Controls for this can be found on the Sound Editor/Inspector for an individual sound asset, or on the Audio Groups Editor for all groups other than "default"
    - There are some bits specific to HTML5 that will act differently with these controls, so please do review the issue below or the manual if you have issues when making your changes 
    - For more on all of the above, plus a sample project, see [#2732](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2732)

- **UI Layers Changes**
    - HTML5 is now supported (although there are known issues with this reported already) [#9198](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9198)
    - Added a Preference for your default asset anchor position [#9774](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9774)
    - The Room Editor no longer updates your position coordinates when changing the anchor of an element in a flex panel (but a Preference has also been added to keep the old behaviour if you want) [#9698](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9698)
    - Other than the frequently-reported one in the section below, there are far too many bugs fixed to list here individually, so please see the changelist via the link in the "Beta 1" heading above

- **Fixed UI Layer Drawing On Room Change/Restart**
    - Fixed an issue found in the 2023.13 runtimes where the drawing of elements on the same UI Layer is flipped after changing to a different room
    - This was most-commonly seen when using our blog post's sample game project and its Esc menu's text/button draw order would change
    - For more, see [#10311](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10311) - again, lots of duplicates for this one, so consider all reports fixed
    - Also see the similar-but-opposite-results issues given in [#10474](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10474) and [#10390](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10390) where the draw order using "depth" was incorrect _until_ the room was restarted/changed and then became fixed

- **Code Editor 2 Changes**
    - Lots of bugs have been fixed - especially to do with colouring, tooltips, and F1/MMB to open the correct target
    - As per usual, there are far too many others to list here individually, so please see the changelist via the link in the "Beta 1" heading above

- **Bug-Reporter Changes**
    - Now automatically attaches your project's layout files also if a sample project has been provided by you [#10079](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10079)
    - Enterprise users submitting privately are now shown a much more helpful error dialog while they have not accepted the organisation invite sat waiting on their GitHub profile page, replaces a vague "unprocessable_entity" error dialog shown in earlier IDEs [#9964](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9964)

- **Package Manager Searching Changes**
    - Update package searching to filter by their short description and keywords (although none of the packages have keywords yet)
    - For more, see [#10076](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10076)

- **GX.games Now Supports Transparent Backgrounds**
    - Added support for rendering with a transparent background
    - For more, see [#10305](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10305)
 
- **Android Support For `windowLayoutInDisplayCutoutMode`**
    - Support has been added for slightly older APIs (pre-35) to support edge-to-edge displays when there are cut-outs
    - API 35+ this is always enabled in the Android tools, so this setting only affects older versions
    - For more, see [#8186](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8186)

- **Deprecated `instance_change()`**
    - Added this function to the Deprecated Behaviours section inside Game Options > Main
    - {% include important.html content="If your project uses this function you **will** need to tick this Game Option now, otherwise you will get a code error in-game that it could not be found" %}
    - For more, see [#10299](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10299)

- **Audio Emitter Function Changes**
    - `audio_emitter_gain()` now allows an optional parameter for setting the ramp time, so it matches what `audio_sound_gain()` and `audio_group_set_gain()` have had for a while
    - And the two other functions have had their time parameter made optional, so now all three functions are consistent
    - For more on all of the above, plus a sample project, see [#9386](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9386)

- **Convex Hull Function Changed Since 2024.13**
    - `sprite_get_convex_hull()` can now take the sprite subimage as an additional parameter
    - For more, see [#9784](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9784)

- **Debug GUI Additions**
    - Added several new functions for specifying which view/section a new control is to be added to, confirm if a control exists, and to delete a control
    - Note that this also changed the return values for several other existing dbg_... functions, so bear this in mind as you may need to update your code now
    - For more, see [#10014](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10014)

- **Debug Playback Event Changed Since 2024.13**
    - `debug_input_playback()` in 2024.13 runtimes had names for its map's "type" and "return" keys which do not match standards used in other events
    - Now, the type is called "event_type", per other system events, and the return have has been changed into lowercase and separated by underscores
    - If you have been using this function in 2024.13 you will now need to update your code accordingly
    - For more on all of the above, plus a sample project, see [#10189](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10189)

- **Matrix Function Changes**
    - `matrix_multiply()` has been optimised and also now takes an optional parameter for supplying a premade matrix to reuse
    - For more, plus a sample project showing the before-and-after, see [#10083](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10083)

- **Misc IDE Performance Fixes**
    - Code Editor 2: Causes massive lag when typing anywhere in the IDE after going AFK and then returning [#7203](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7203)
    - Room Editor: "Select Tiles" tool causes a lot of lag after GM has been open for a while [#8830](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8830)
