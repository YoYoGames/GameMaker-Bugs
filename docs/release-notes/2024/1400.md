Download Links: [Windows](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2024.1400.0.79.exe) - [macOS](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-2024.1400.0.79.pkg) - [Ubuntu Beta](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Beta-2024.1400.0.79.deb)

{% include important.html content="GMRT Users: Please be aware these 2024.1400/2024.14 releases are incompatible with GMRT 0.16.0 and older - you will need to install newer 0.16.5+ packages in Package Manager before any projects will build using GMRT" %}

<br>

## Beta 1 - [IDE 79/Runtime 79 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A<2025-04-24%20)  (Apr , 2025)

- **IDE Updater: Mac IDE Supported**
    - Although you won't actually see any evidence of this until whenever Beta 2 is released, Mac IDE users can now see and take advantage of the new updates process that's been available on Windows for the last few GameMaker versions
    - You will now get the newer-style updater notifcations and the installer will be downloaded in the background as you use GameMaker
    - Your IDE installation will then be updated on restarting from the dialog/the next time GameMaker is started
    - For more on this IDE updater process, see the manual

- **Better DPI Support In The IDE**
    - This release sees the start of a number of improvements to DPI-handling throughout the IDE, especially when moving GameMaker between monitors
    - For more, see [#3196](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3196)
    - Note that there are a number of known issues already reported for button/checkbox sizes now being slightly too large and/or positions being slightly incorrect, so please do check for an existing report before filing minor issues like this
    - However, if you find a serious issue with this functionality that you did not have in 2024.13 (e.g. startup DPI being wildly wrong or moving GameMaker between monitors causes problems), then of course do report these urgently - or comment on any existing issues to say you have the same (send us your Upload a Bug/Sample Package link in your comment)

- **Fixed Lauching GM Via Opening Your Project**
    - Fixed an issue where double-clicking a .yyp file to launch GM could open an empty/blank and unusable GameMaker window on some people's machines
    - For more, see [#10309](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10309) - note that we had a lot of duplicate reports for this one, so you can consider everyone's reports fixed

- **Creating New Projects No Longer Adds The Empty Default Groups In The Asset Browser**
    - Changed the default value for the "Create default groups in new projects" Preference to be OFF, so that the Asset Browser is back to containing only the content that _you_ have created
    - Which means that when creating new projects you will only see the default Room1 that GameMaker always creates for you
    - This communicates more clearly to everyone new to GameMaker that you do not have to create all your sprites in the "Sprites" group, all objects in the "Objects" group, and so on...
    - It does not change the project structure when it's saved out - just that the Asset Browser won't show these unused folders
    - For more, see [#9731](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9731)
    - Note that for existing users/GameMaker installations you may need to change the Preference yourself if you want to get this change, as this release will not modify your current Preferences value

- **IDE Now Advises On Startup If YYAL Failed To Load**
    - Fixed an issue on Windows/Mac/Ubuntu where GM would crash on startup when YYAL fails to load for any reason
    - Now, you will get a warning message advising you that this problem happened and a little hint to check your ui.log for any information why and potentially how to fix
    - As this new dialog says, in these situations you can still start GameMaker and edit your project okay, but audio previews will not work in the Sound Editor
    - For more, see [#10222](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10222)
    - Note that this is ultimately why Ubuntu 22 (and various other unsupported distros) stopped working as of 2024.1300 Beta 5, so you may well find GM now launches on those distros again, just with no sound support
    - However, Ubuntu 22 is still classed as unsupported since 2024.13

- **Previewing Sounds In The IDE Is More Accurate**
    - Previewing a sound in the Sound Editor or Inspector now reflects the current Sound Editor settings for that asset
    - This means your options can be heard during the preview inside the IDE and you no longer have to build your game in order to hear the difference after making a change
    - Be aware that this does mean when you're editing the properties of your Sound assets you may trigger that sound to be converted on-demand, so bear in mind that this might cause short delays as this happens  
    - For more, see [#8632](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8632)
    - Note also that the UI/UX of many of these Sound Editor/Inspector settings will also be updated in a future 2024.1400 Beta: [#9640](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9640)

- **Output Paths For Streamed Sounds And Audio Groups**
    - Added the ability to specify a path for storing streamed audio files, so they are not in the root folder
    - Controls for this can be found on the Sound Editor/Inspector for an individual sound asset, or on the Audio Groups Editor for all groups other than "default"
    - Note that there are some bits specific to HTML5 that will act differently with these controls, so please do review the issue below or the manual if you have issues making changes 
    - For more on all of the above, plus a sample project, see [#2732](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2732)

- **UI Layers Changes**
    - HTML5 is now supported (although there are known issues with this reported already) [#9198](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9198)
    - Added a Preference for your default asset anchor position [#9774](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9774)
    - The Room Editor no longer updates your position coordinates when changing the anchor of an element in a flex panel (but a Preference has also been added to keep the old behaviour if you want) [#9698](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9698)
    - Other than the frequently-reported one in the section below, there are far too many bugs fixed to list here individually, so please see the changelist via the link in the "Beta 1" heading above

- **Fixed UI Layer Drawing On Room Change/Restart**
    - Fixed an issue found in the 2023.13 runtimes where the drawing of elements on the same UI Layer is flipped after changing to a different room
    - This was most-commonly seen when using our blog post's sample game project and its Esc menu's text/button draw order would change
    - For more, see [#10311](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10311) - again, lots of duplicates for this one, so consider all reports fixed

- **Code Editor 2 Changes**
    - Lots of bugs have been fixed - especially to do with colouring, tooltips, and F1/MMB to open the correct target
    - As per usual, there are far too many others to list here individually, so please see the changelist via the link in the "Beta 1" heading above

- **Bug-Reporter Changes**
    - Now automatically attaches your project's layout files also if a sample project has been provided by you [#10079](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10079)
    - Enterprise users submitting privately are now shown a much more helpful error dialog while they have not accepted the organisation invite sat waiting on their GitHub profile page, replaces a vague "unprocessable_entity" error dialog shown in earlier IDEs [#9964](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9964)

- **GX.games Now Supports Transparent Backgrounds**
    - Added support for rendering with a transparent background
    - For more, see [#10305](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10305)
 
- **Android Support For `windowLayoutInDisplayCutoutMode`**
    - Support has been added for slightly older APIs (pre-35) to support edge-to-edge displays when there are cut-outs
    - API 35+ this is always enabled in the Android tools, so this setting only affects older versions
    - For more, see [#8186](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8186)

- **Audio Emitter Function Changes**
    - `audio_emitter_gain()` now allows an optional parameter for setting the ramp time, so it matches what `audio_sound_gain()` and `audio_group_set_gain()` have had for a while
    - And the two other functions have had their time parameter made optional, so now all three functions are consistent
    - For more on all of the above, plus a sample project, see [#9386](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9386)

- **Convex Hull Function Changed Since 2024.13**
    - `sprite_get_convex_hull()` can now take the sprite subimage as an additional parameter
    - For more, see [#9784](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9784)

- **Debug Playback Event Changed Since 2024.13**
    - `debug_input_playback()` in 2024.13 runtimes had names for its map's "type" and "return" keys which do not match standards used in other events
    - Now, the type is called "event_type", per other system events, and the return have has been changed into lowercase and separated by underscores
    - If you have been using this function in 2024.13 you will now need to update your code accordingly
    - For more, see [#10189](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10189)

- **Misc Performance Fixes**
    - Code Editor 2: Causes massive lag when typing anywhere in the IDE after going AFK and then returning [#7203](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7203)
    - Room Editor: "Select Tiles" tool causes a lot of lag after GM has been open for a while [#8830](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8830)
