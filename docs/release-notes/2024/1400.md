## Beta 14 - [IDE 901/Runtime 888 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A2025-09-11..2025-09-24)  (Sept 25, 2025)

- **Package Manager Auto-Updates**
    - Added support for enabling/disabling automatic silent updating to newer package versions when they are released
    - You can now right-click on packages and toggle this value (by default, no packages are set to auto-update)
    - For more, see [#11381](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11381)

- **Spine Premultipled Alpha Control Functions Added**
    - A change was made earlier in 2024.14 that would automatically set the appropriate blend mode to correctly draw Spine sprites that use premultiplied alpha, as long as the current blend mode is set to the default (if the blend mode is set to anything else it's assumed that you have set it for a reason).
    - However, there have been some projects that this does not work well for, and so we've added a couple of functions to disable this again:
        - `draw_enable_skeleton_blend_override(enable)` - "true" enables the override (new behaviour) and "false" to use the previous behaviour. (The default setting is true.)
        - `draw_get_enable_skeleton_blend_override()` - returns true/false if the override is enabled or not.
    - For more, see [#12070](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12070)

- **texturegroup_add() Now Supports Buffer Input**
    - This function now allows passing premade buffers as well as filenames for your sprites
    - The format to use can be found on the issue or in the manual
    - For more, see [#12084](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12084)

- **post_textures.bat Now Accesses More Enviroment Variables**
    - Previously, this batch file did not support a number of GM's enviroment variables - now, it is able to do so
    - For more, see [#12008](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12008)

- **IDE Stability Fixes**
    - Bug Reporter: GM crash when clicking on successful bug submission hyperlink [#12118](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12118)
    - Debugger: Projects containing TileSet prefabs will cause an exception during debugger startup [#12066](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12066)
    - Debugger: [Mac IDE] GM crash and unwanted child windows when running again after detaching workspaces [#11894](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11894)
    - Project Load: GM crashes when loading tile data which has somehow been set to zero height/width values [#12020](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12020)
    - Project Save: Deleting specific Sprite in attached project can cause all future changes to not save and load failures thereafter [#12069](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12069)

- **Code Editor 2/Feather Other Fixes**
    - Code Editor 2: Scrolls the editor unwantedly when affecting the first line of an event which required scrolling down to see [#11976](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11976)
    - Code Editor 2: Colouring is broken after pasting code from outside GM into a newly-created Script in my project [#11962](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11962)

    - Code Editor 2: Disabling CE2 in prefs displays a dialog stating that CE2 was already disabled, when it wasn't [#11770](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11770)
    - Code Editor 2: Variable colors still fail to load first time opening a project after update [#11855](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11855)
    - Code Editor 2: Newly-duplicated prefab objects do not have highlighting until the project is reloaded [#10823](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10823)
    - Code Editor 2: Changing an object name or instance name doesn't update in room creation code until tab is closed and reopened [#9516](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9516)
    - Code Editor 2: Tab and Enter not being able to be rebound cause code completion frustration [#9268](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9268)

## Beta 13 - [IDE 892/Runtime 879 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A2025-09-03..2025-09-10)  (Sept 11, 2025)

- **Welcome Tab**
    - This release adds a quick introduction screen for new users to understand the GameMaker IDE layout more quickly and learn where to find common controls, plus how to open the manual
    - The first time that you open any project in this release you will see the new tab in your workspace area
    - Once you have seen it the first time, it won't reopen again automatically, so you can close the tab once you're done with the information there
    - Should you need to open it again, the Welcome Tab can be opened at any time from the Help menu
    - (Obviously, if you have it open when you close a project it will form part of _that_ project's layout and so will still be there the next time you open that one project, so bear that in mind)

- **Prefabs Now Allow Editing More Values Directly**
    - The logic has been changed so that rather than only a handful of values relating to prefabs can be edited/overridden, now it's all but a specific few can be edited as of this release
    - This means there is less need to duplicate a prefab into your project just so you can change some of its basic values 
    - For more, see [#11842](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11842)
 
- **Debug Overlays Can Now Toggle Gamepad Input Support**
    - Added ability to toggle gamepad support in dbg_...() gadgets, but also control whether you want to only one specific gamepad to interact or if you still want to allow all pads
    - Added 2 new optional params to `show_debug_overlay()` to facilitate this - now it's `show_debug_overlay(enable,[minimised],[scale],[alpha],[gamepad_enable],[gamepad_index]...)`
    - "gamepad_enable" can be true or false (default is true) and controls allowing gamepad input
    - "gamepad_index" is either -1 (default) for allowing all gamepads or you can specify the gamepad index to limit interactions to (e.g., player 1 only)
    - The new function `dbg_get_gamepad_input()` will return a real number to show the status of gamepad input in the debug overlay
    - A return of -1 indicates gamepad input is disabled
    - A return of -3 indicates gamepad input is enabled for all gamepads
    - Any other number indicates that only _that_ specific gamepad is allowed for debug overlay input
    - For more, see [#11705](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11705)

- **Extensions: macOS YYC Now Has support For Inserting Frameworks Into Your Builds**
    - You can now create a "MacFrameworks" folder in your project source and any Framework .zip files in here will be added automatically during your macOS YYC builds
    - Note that this is supported on YYC only
    - For more, see [#10429](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10429)

- **IDE Stability Fixes**
    - GoTo: GM crashes with an OutOfRangeException when reopening after a previous search returned no matches [#11972](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11972)
    - Startup: [Mac IDE] GM crash after install if invalid runtime RSS feed values are set in Preferences [#11905](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11905)
    - Stability: [Mac IDE] GM crash when loading my project in 2024.1400 Beta 12, due to menubar issues [#11961](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11961) / UI/UX: [Mac IDE] Some menubar items are disabled in 2024.1400 Beta 12 until I do a license update [#11988](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11988)
    - Stability: GM crash while upgrading HotKeys file [#11470](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11470)

- **Code Editor 2 Brace-Indentation Fixes**
    - A variety of fixes have been made for automatic indentation of braces - especially in the case of using space as your separator in Preferences, rather than tabs
    - It was also found that "None" mode still applied auto-indentation in some cases, and so this has been fixed as well
    - A note for those who place their opening curly braces on the line below their function/loop declaration lines - you might want to try the "Braces" mode, rather than "Full", and see if this matches more closely what you want the editor to do for you, as "Full" mode is intended to do a lot more and conform to specific popular coding styles
    - For more, see [#11680](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11680)

- **Code Editor 2/Feather Other Fixes**

## Beta 11 - [IDE 880/Runtime 871 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A2025-08-15..2025-08-25)  (August 27, 2025)

- **ProjectTool Release**
    - Released v2024.14.145 to go along with this Beta release
    - Due to the new Game Options below, you will need this one before you will be able to import/export many projects and packages!
    - Note that it is not the bundled version with the IDE this time - you will need to download it from Package Manager (_and_ read below to find how to set Package Manager to notify you and/or auto-update ProjectTool in future!)

- **macOS Ventura Support Reinstated**
    - The issue with the audio library has now been resolved and so now users of this old macOS release can now start 2024.1400 GameMaker releases again
    - For a tiny bit more, see [#11623](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11623)

- **Package Manager Additions**
    - Added being able to specify via the RMB context menu which packages you want to see update notifications for [#11380](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11380)
    - Similarly, from that same context menu you can now also say which packages should automatically update themselves [#11381](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11381)

- **Windows: Re-Added Support For Legacy DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_DISCARD"**
    - Windows 11's "optimisations for windowed games" can cause issues for games which use transparency extensions and other graphical tricks
    - Accordingly, there is now a new Game Option added for enabling the legacy swap chain that GameMaker has used in the past, which will not get these OS optimisations automatically applied
    - This should allow your extensions to work again as they did in previous GM releases (however, we cannot prevent further changes in Windows itself causing future issues here) 
    - For more info, see [#11489](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11489)

- **Windows: Added A New Timing Method**
    - Some machines can see issues when losing focus, which can then cause timing functions to go wrong 
    - Accordingly, the new `display_set_timing_method(tm_countvsyncs_winalt)` constant and timing method has been added to help mitigate this situation
    - You can now call this function and set the method early in your game startup and see if this resolves any issues on your player's machine  
    - Fixes the issue below:
        - In-Game: [Windows] delta_time breaks when the game window loses focus on some machines [#11562](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11562)

- **UI Layers: Changes To mouse_x/y values**
    - "mouse_x" and "mouse_y" for instances on UI Layers now use GUI co-ords rather than regular layer co-ords
    - This means you may need to refactor your code accordingly, so for more info see [#11678](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11678)

- **Autocomplete Fixes For Recent Functions**
    - application_surface_is_draw_enabled() added in 2024.1400 Betas is not documented yet [#11787](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11787)
    - Some others that have been added recently have also now been documented, or improvements made to wording

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Asset Browser: Changing only capitalisation in a group's name gives a false "Invalid name ... " warning [#11809](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11809)
    - Debugger: Disable UI for changing member variable values when real-time debugging is enabled [#11726](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11726)
    - Prefabs: Importing a YYZ that requires a Prefab Collection can stall the import process [#11753](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11753)
    - Prefabs: Trying to make a prefab object the child of a regular object when that prefab is used in the project will cause a project load failure [#10860](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10860)
    - Sprite/Room Editors: Spine sprites which have premultiplied alpha disabled are drawn incorrectly [#11744](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11744)
    - Sprite Editor: Importing multi-frame images (e.g. strips) is broken in some 2024.1400 Betas [#11758](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11758)
    - Sprite Editor: GM crash when closing all animation frames at once #11649 / Sprite Editor: GM crash when importing multiple images into a sprite at once [#11180](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11180)

- **Other GMS2 Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - In-Game: Instance creation code is still run when that instance's creation is cancelled by a room transition [#11778](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11778)
    - In-Game: OpenGL platforms sometimes fail to stage texture samplers [#11449](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11449)

    - In-Game: [GX.games] buffer_load() cannot read Included Files if they are in a subdirectory [#11807](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11807)
    - In-Game: [GX.games] keyboard_check_...() no longer registers the Shift key in 2024.1400 runtimes [#11674](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11674)

## Beta 9 - [IDE 865/Runtime 857 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A2025-07-16..2025-08-05)  (August 07, 2025)

- **ProjectTool Update Released**
    - A new 2024.14.143 version has been released to match this Beta
    - Fixes issues such as not being able to export a .yyz in recent builds, plus a handful of project-specific issues that were reported to us
    - Be aware this release's IDE installer already contains this version of PT, but if you're going between 2024.13.1 and these Betas with your project(s) or rolling back to an older Beta IDE for some reason, then remember to install this version of PT yourself inside Package Manager within those IDEs
    - Also fixes these other misc issues:
       - ProjectTool: Converting should create a new subfolder to hold the files, the same way the Create Project button does [#11447](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11447)
       - ProjectTool: Source field value should default to the current project's path [#11446](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11446)

- **Code Editor 2/Feather/GmlSpec Fixes**
    - There are nearly 60 fixes in this release for Code Editor 2 or Feather, so of course not all of them can be listed here, but see [this filtered changelist for just these changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A2025-07-16..2025-08-05%20("Code%20Editor%202"%20OR%20"Feather"))
    - In summary, some of the headline changes include:
       - Lots of fixes for when the LSP doesn't start during loading your projects
       - Lots of fixes for code-colouring breaking mid-way through lines (e.g., arguments, template strings, piped values)
       - Some fixes for autocomplete not adding unwanted indents during some operations, plus highlighting the correct argument as you're typing
       - Several fixes for changes to code files not being saved when their windows are closed, especially if the editor was in a child GameMaker IDE window
       - Tab indents slipping out of expected alignment as you add more indentation levels
       - Feather's "SyntaxErrors" profile is now a little more "relaxed" and also the IDE no longer forces a Preferences value change for this profile
       - Feather's message panel icons are now better scaled in the Mac IDE and so don't get cut-off
       - And there have been lots of GmlSpec file fixes so that autocomplete helper text is more accurate and also gets shown in full every time, plus some missing reserved keywords have now been added to the file properly for [#11428](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11428)

- **Notes Can Now Open Automatically As "Readme" Windows On Project Load**
    - This release includes an early look at a new feature where a Note in your project can be set to open automatically its formatted markdown window the first time someone opens a copy of the project
    - For example, if you're developing a tutorial series and you ship .yyz files for your users to follow you could include an offline copy of the tutorial text and images inside the project and know that it would open automatically when the person created their local project
    - If the Note is called "Readme" and is placed in the root of your Asset Browser, then GameMaker will always show it the first time someone opens the project
    - However, you can call your file something else and still click a checkbox to toggle that you would like it to show on that first project load
    - Right now, a couple of our Start Page template projects have placeholder examples that you will see if you open them in this IDE - in future our readmes will show information on what the template contains and link to any videos or external sites
    - Note (pun intended) that this issue is still in-development and issues remain for this release, but you are able to set your projects up now and also see the examples mentioned above
    - For more, including a tiny sample .yyz file which shows the system, see [#11638](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11638)

- **Prefab Library: Can Now Duplicate Folders/Entire Collections**
    - Added an option into the content menu so that you can now duplicate the full contents of folders/collections at once, rather than having to add each prefab individually across multiple operations
    - For a little more, see [#10940](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10940)

- **PS5: Added Support For Low-Energy Mode**
    - You can now enable this mode in your games and it will be supported on the console
    - Please note that this mode now defaults to ON if you create a new project or param.sfo file
    - For more, please see the issue in the PS5 repository (if you have PS5 access)

- **Rooms/Sequences Support Persistent Aligntment Values For Text Instances**
    - Added support for text instances to have persistent alignment in-game
    - This is done via a combination of changed/new gadgets in the Room Editor/Sequence Editor, plus the new `layer_text_origin()`
    - This function can be used with a range of new `origin_...` constants for standard values like topleft, bottomright, etc., to set the origin for a text instance
    - And `layer_text_get_origin()` can be used to get which constant is in effect for a given instance
    - For more, including a sample .yyz file which shows the new functionality, see [#11637](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11637)
    - Also fixes the below issue:
        - In-Game: Non-wrapped text instances ignore their alignment values [#10455](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10455)

- **SWF/SVG: Performance Changes And New Functions For Controlling Memory Usage**
    - Now, on most platforms (all except PS4, PS5 and HTML5), the drawing of SWF and SVG sprites is accelerated by caching them in vertex buffers first before drawing them. This trades reduced CPU load from manually transforming vertices and calculating anti-aliasing data each frame with an increased number of draw calls.
    - In general, this is a large win; however, the amount of cache memory used for this new method is something you can control via the use of several new `vector_sprite_cache_...()` functions that have been added in this release
    - You can query the amount of cache usage at any time
    - Cached items will be automatically pruned when reaching an age value you set, plus you can control the rate of pruning these old items once they reach your chosen age
    - Any sprites which attempt to draw when there is not enough of this new cache available will still draw fine - they will simply do so using the regular method that's been used for all GMS2 runtime releases until now
    - And, if you want, you can turn the new method off and continue using the standard method instead by simply setting the cache limit to 0
    - For all the info on these functions, see [#11624](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11624)
 
- **Templates: Description Changes For Blank Project Templates**
    - Updated the descriptions for the two "Blank game" and "Blank pixel game" templates to clarify the differences between them and when you might want to pick one versus the other 
    - For more, see [#10233](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10233)

- **Templates: Fixes for "Puzzle Slider" Visual and "Twin Stick Shooter" Visual**
    - The previous versions of these two templates fail to run as of 2024.13.0, so the coding issues have now been fixed and the new versions have been released
    - However, if you have already previously downloaded either/both of these projects, then be aware that you need to delete your downloaded package from GameMaker's settings folder and then download the new version again by creating a new project on the Start Page (alternatively, you can just apply the coding fix yourself when creating projects from those old template versions)
    - For more, see [#10053](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10053)

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**

## Beta 7 - [IDE 841/Runtime 836 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A2025-06-26..2025-07-01)  (July 03, 2025)

- **ProjectTool Release**
    - A 2024.14.139 release has already been set live for supporting the Project Export/Project Load fixes below, plus some of the other changes
    - Be aware that if you do not update to this version you will likely have issues when trying to make .yyz exports of your projects using this IDE+runtime combination
    - Note also that to open a project edited/created in this Beta into Monthly, your Monthly will also need to be using this version of ProjectTool (or newer)

- **Fixes For Primitive-Drawing, Support For "Legacy" Values**
    - On all targets there has always been a little compatibility tweak so that DirectX 11 in GM/GMS2 looks the same as GM: Studio 1.x (DirectX 9) did and maintain longtime compatibility within GM - which unfortunately meant the primitive functions could draw the positions off by one pixel in some cases / on some targets
    - This tweak is no longer performed as standard
    - However, to control this, a new Game Options "deprecated behaviours" checkbox has been added also - this defaults to ON when opening existing projects and OFF for all new projects createda as of this release
    - When OFF, the values will be passed through as un-modified as possible - be aware some OpenGL targets (Ubuntu, Consoles) still always require a small automatic tweak to their values
    - When ON this will restoring the old tweaked values, should you need to maintain consistency
    - For more, see [#11062](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11062)
    - Note that at the time of writing/in this runtime release this one has already been reopened for a further fix on Ubuntu, but be aware the controls _are_ in already and work fine on most targets

- **`code_is_compiled()` is now a compile-time function**
    - For a little more, see [#11234](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11234)

## Beta 6 - [IDE 838/Runtime 833 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A2025-06-18..2025-06-25)  (June 26, 2025)

 - **ProjectTool Release**
    - A 2024.14.137 release has already been set live for supporting the Project Export/Project Load fixes below, plus some of the other changes

 - **Room Editor: UI Layers Dropped Into A Room Now Offers To Create The Correct Layer**
    - UI Layer prefabs dropped onto a different layer type now trigger the usual dialog asking if you want to make a new layer of the correct type and add the prefab onto that
    - Matches the functionality that other assets (Objects requiring an Instance layer, Sprites and Sequences requiring an Asset layer, etc.) have had for a long time 
    - For more, see [#11094](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11094)

 - **More Fixes For Fonts Having Been Incorrectly Always Affected By DPI**
    - More fixes have been made to instances where DPI values were still incorrectly being applied to your fonts, so now IDE previews and in-game results are much more accurate
    - Fixes these two, for example:
        - Room Editor: Distorted font assets in 2024.1400 Beta 3+, now that other DPI calculations have been changed/fixed [#11042](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11042)
        - In-Game: Room text element measurement can differ from IDE representation [#10893](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10893)
    - However, be aware that if your project is in this situation already, then you still need to regenerate the font(s) yourself in order to recalculate the desired values now you have this fixed release

 - **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Project Export: Projects with non-ascii characters present in filename do not export [#9644](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9644)

## Beta 5 - [IDE 831/Runtime 827 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A2025-06-11..2025-06-17)  (June 19, 2025)

 - **ProjectTool Updated Again**
    - A 2024.14.135 release has already been set live for supporting the Room Editor/In-Game sprite override change below, plus some of the other changes
    - As this is another change to saving/loading assets, please ensure you're set as using this version in Package Manager > _GM Tools_
    - Note also that as of this release you will only see the ProjectTool package relevant for the OS you're using (e.g., you won't be shown the Mac or Ubuntu package when you're using a Windows PC)

- **Room Editor Allows Customising The Sprite Assigned To An Individual Instance**
    - You can now double-click an instance within the Room Editor and change which Sprite is assigned to this instance
    - This means you can now better preview and position assets in your room
    - These sprite values are also then used as the sprite_index upon game start
    - For more, see [#3733](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3733)

- **Android: Added Support For 16Kb Page Sizes**
    - Google Play will later this year require all submissions to use 16kb texture page sizes
    - This release adds that support, so you have plenty of time to build, test, and submit your updates
    - For more, see [#10894](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10894)

- **Added Support For SVGs Containing Animations**
    - The sprite editor will now import animations within an SVG image and save them as separate frames inside the Sprite Editor, so then you can see and use all of the animation contained in that image file just the same as you would a PNG-based Sprite
    - For more, see [#10193](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10193)

- **Gamepad Mappings Fixes And Updated Database**
    - Previously, the mapping for any button/axis which used a +/- sign before it was not handled correctly and so the button was not detected properly
    - Now, the mapping is handled correctly and so your input will be detected properly
    - As part of this change, the gamepad mappping database has been updated also, so you should find more pads work better than ever; however, it's worth testing this change well in your gamepad code - especially if you already have custom mappings being set by your game
    - For more, see [#8933](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8933)

- **UI Layers Measurement Functions Added**
    - Added two new custom measurement functions for UI Layers:
        - `flexpanel_node_set_measure_function(node, function)` adds the given function to the node, and when a layout is calculated and a measurement is required the given GML function will be called with the parameters "width", "widthType", "height", "heightType" (see Yoga's documentation) and then return a struct containing the calculated width and/or height
        - `flexpanel_node_get_measure_function(node)` gets the measure function for a given node
    - These two expose existing Yoga functionality for manipulating your UI at runtime
    - For more and a sample project showing how these two work, see [#7419](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7419)

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**

    - Prefabs: Copying the oButton prefab object to a project causes resource load failures. Error changes if done multiple times [#9831](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9831)
    - ProjectTool: Local asset package exports have an unexpected filesize limit which should be removed [#10279](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10279)
    - Tileset Editor: Tile animation speed of 0 results in very fast playback speed in-game, so IDE should show the same [#10977](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10977)
    - UI/UX: [Mac IDE] Default DPI values are not correctly scaled on Retina displays [#10986](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10986)

 - **Windows IDE Updater Updated**
    - Named the executable something safer-sounding and identifiable as a GameMaker tool than the old name of "WindowsAutoUpdater"
    - Note that the updater which is included in this release has the old name, but right now you have the choice to install the new updater manually from Package Manager
    - However, the next Beta will therefore include a version of the IDE updater which does have the new name
    - For a little more, see [#10805](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10805)

 - **Even More `texturegroup_...()` Changes**
    - Added `texturegroup_delete()` to match the new `texturegroup_add()` already added in 2024.14 [#10678](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10678)
    - Plus `texturegroup_exists()` for checking whether a specified texture group exists or not [#10919](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10919)
    - Also fixed that `texturegroup_add()` allowed multiple texture groups to be added with the same name [#10921](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10921)

 - **`array_push()` Changes**
    - This function now behaves like the array is a growable list

## Beta 3 - [IDE 815/Runtime 815 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A2025-05-17..2025-05-28)  (May 20, 2025)

 - **ProjectTool Updated Again**
    - A 2024.14.131 release has now been set live for supporting the Sound Editor/Inspector change below, plus some of the other changes
    - As this is a change to saving/loading assets, please ensure you're set as using this version in Package Manager

- **Xbox XDK Version Updated**
    - If you're an Xbox developer, then be aware you will need to use a newer XDK version as of this GameMaker release
    - Please see the setup wiki page for the specifics
    - {% include important.html content="Please ensure you're using the correct XDK version _and_ you have updated your console firmware to match, clean your cache and then try building again before you submit any bugs!" %}

- **Room Editor Performance Fixes**
    - Fixed a longstanding issue which caused performance problems when editing tile layers in your rooms
    - Now, in most cases you will not see any delays, but be aware of you are selecting and copy/pasting hundreds of tiles at once there is still some lag - which will be fixed for a separate bug report
    - For more, see #10710 (and there were several older/newer duplicates of this one, so all have been closed by this fix)
    - Also addressed the followinmg issues:
    - Room Editor: Please Speed Up Room Editing [#10670](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10670)
    - Room Editor: Performance worsens as more instances are added to a layer [#10088](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10088)
    - Room Editor: Copy-and-pasting assets is extremely slow on large projects [#7653](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7653)
    - And this one actually crept into Beta 2 unannounced and seems to be working fine according to the recent comments (thanks!):
    - Room Editor: Copy-and-pasting assets is extremely slow on large projects [#7653](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7653)

- **Sound Editor/Inspector Improved clarity Of Editor Options**
    - A number of the settings shown for sounds have now been renamed so they're clearer about what they will result in
    - At the same time, several of them have been reordered/collapsed into dropdowns rather than radioboxes, and also settings that are made redundant by others are now enabled/disabled accordingly
    - There is also a new section for showing the output size of your sound, based on the settings you have currently chosen - and this information can be collapsed/expanded and even copied to the clipboard for use elsewhere
    - All of this does mean that if you change the audio file used by a sound, or you pick a new setting which would make a material difference to its output, the sound will be processed immediately and all of the values will be updated with the new results
    - Depending on the size of the audio file, this can obviously take a few seconds, and so you will see the values blank out and a spinner appears while the sound file is being built
    - Also, if your Sound is missing a source audio file the info box will make this much clearer now
    - For more and a small sample project to see the new changes in action, see [#9640](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9640)
    - Note that this change also fixes a few issues when loading Sound assets in projects:
    - Inspector: [Sound] Previewing very short audio files often does not set the button states correctly [#10256](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10256)
    - Project Save: GM crash in ConvertAudio when converting a large number of files dragged onto the IDE at the same time [#10602](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10602)
    - Project Load: Crash during ConvertAudio stops my project from loading [#10608](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10608)
    - Stability: PurgeAudio crash due to file lock [#10445](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10445)

- **Fix For Code Editor 1 Hotkeys Not Working**
    - Further to the non-QWERTY keyboard fixes in the last release, it became clear that a number of the reports were actually for CE1 specifically and hotkeys not working
    - This turned out to be the use of custom code snippets and a problem when declaring them, so those users seeing keyboard issues actually had duplicate entries and so the hotkey was being reused- this then caused an error which stopped all remaining hotkeys from being loaded
    - Now, all default hotkeys are loaded and _then_ the custom ones, with new logging and an error dialog shown if your snippets file contains this problem
    - For more, see [#10843](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10843)

- **Code Editor 2 Fixes**
    - There are a number of fixes in this release, so please do see the changelist for specifics and to learn about how the changes have been implemented

- **More Ways To Manage Texture Pages**
    - Game Options will now export your texture pages' .json files when clicking the Preview button, so this information can be edited manually (if you wish) and ultimately used in-game later on [#10735](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10735)
    - Added a `texturegroup_delete()` to match the new `texturegroup_add()` added in Beta 2 [#10678](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10678)

- **Audio Error Suppression Now Expanded To Account For Coding Problems Also**
    - Audio errors have always been shown when the game legitimately fails to find a source file (such as having newlines in the string used as the filename and passing this string to `audio_create_stream()`)
    - Now, these can be supressed by the two existing methods for "hiding" audio errors in the output log only
    - For more, see [#10198](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10198)

- **`draw_get_circle_precision()` Added**
    - "Added" this function (it was actually added several releases ago, but not shown correctly in autocomplete, etc.)
    - Can be used to get back values set by `draw_set_circle_precision()`
    - For a tiny bit more, see [#3002](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3002)

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Code Editor 2: GM unstable when changing a collision event between parent/child objects [#10700](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10700)

    - Room Editor: UI Layers should not require mouseover to see whether they are visible [#10780](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10780)
    - Room Editor: Precision errors when scaling down Sprites [#10795](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10795)
    - Room Editor: Pressing F2 after selecting a non-UI layer instance from the instance list tries to rename the room tab instead of the instance [#10703](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10703)
    - UI/UX: Clicking on and off a text box causes the caret speed to increase rapidly [#10701](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10701)

- **Other GMS2 Runtime Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Building Projects: Struct literals containing keys that have as asterisk as the name cause compile fails [#10718](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10718)
    - Building Projects: [GX.games] Igor fails when trying to build dynamic textures with a subfolder specified [#10699](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10699)

    - In-Game: Physics collisions between two infinite mass objects can generate an infinite velocity and cause an infinite loop (now, the inifite velocity will not be generated, but you might still need to review your code) [#10716](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10716)
    - In-Game: [YYC] "other" in a script function stored in an instance variable is treated as a method, results in wrong instance used [#10625](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10625)

## Beta 2 - [IDE 808/Runtime 810 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A2025-04-29..2025-05-16)  (May 20, 2025)

- {% include important.html content="We are aware already that Mouse Pressed and Released events are not working correctly for HTML5 in this release - [#10717](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10717)" %}

- **IDE Updater: Mac IDE Updates As Of This Release**
    - Mac IDE users will now see the newer-style update notifications appearing over the Start Page and you can download the installer while you work, apply it when you're ready, etc.

 - **ProjectTool Updated**
    - A 2024.14.129 version of ProjectTool has also been released in preparation for this Beta release
    - You will need to install this version in order to be able to use the new Game Option for position_change(), plus some of the other additions in this release
    - Note that as of this Beta release and ProjectTool combination, a number of changes have been made to make ProjectTool more reliable and so you should a) be more reliably able to downgrade projects for use in older IDEs/runtimes, and b) no longer need to update your ProjectTool install alongside every Beta IDE/GMS2/GMRT release unless we actually introduce a change to assets
    - {% include important.html content="If you have any issues opening/importing projects or packages, please ensure you're using this version (or newer) of ProjectTool inside Package Manager and then try again before you submit any bugs!" %}

- **Fixes For Non-QWERTY Keyboards / Numpad When NumLock Is Off**
    - Fixed a number of issues which appeared only when using a Keyboard layout other than QWERTY, or when using a full-size keyboard which has a numberpad and Num Lock was OFF
    - UI/UX: Numpad keys are not obeyed correctly in 2024.13 IDEs when Num Lock is OFF [#10327](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10327)
    - UI/UX: Shortcuts not working properly on QWERTZ keyboards in 2024.13 IDEs [#10217](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10217)
    - UI/UX: Shortcuts not working properly on AZERTY keyboards in 2024.13 IDEs [#10154](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10154)
    - UI/UX: Shortcuts not working properly on Dvorak keyboards in 2024.13 IDEs [#10207](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10207)
    - UI/UX: Numpad Enter is not recognised in .1300 IDEs in CE2, among others [#9190](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9190)
    - Code Editor 1: "GoTo Line" dialog no longer accepts numpad Enter key as confirmation in 2024.13 [#10304](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10304)
    - And a large stack of duplicate reports for each of them - all of which are fixed due to the ones named above

- **Project Health Tool Now Warns For More Types Of Asset Problems**
    - Added warnings for Sounds that are missing their audio file [#9567](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9567)
    - Added warnings for Shaders that are missing either of their vertex/fragment shader files [#9568](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9568)
    - Also fixed that Project Health incorrectly reported files were missing for Sprite Layer Groups in 2024.13 [#9840](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9840)

- **Creating New Assets Now Uses Your Feather Preferences For Naming Conventions (Fixes)**
    - The remaining asset types are now supported also (Notes, Extensions, etc.) - however, their Preferences defaults are intentionally different to all the others, as in many cases you might not want these asset types to confirm to fixed names, etc.
    - For more, see [#10477](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10477)

- **Igor/Asset Compiler: More Errors Highlighted During Builds**
    - A number of errors and warnings that these two tools wrote to your Output window log were not using the correct formatting to make the IDE also show the lines in the Compiler Errors panel for ease of finding them later
    - Now, these loggging messages have all been standardised and will now show up correctly
    - This may of course mean that an error you never knew you had is suddenly showing - this is correct and something for you to rectify in your project or tools setup
    - Additionally, if you are using any form of build automation you may need to account for seeing these errors / change any code you had that detected the old error messages
    - For a little more, see [#10654](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10654)

- **Package Manager: Installation Cache Is No Longer Shared Between Monthly And Beta IDEs**
    - In previous releases if you downloaded a package/prefab in either of your Beta/Monthly installs, then it would immediately appear in the other one as if it was also installed and ready for use
    - In the case of Prefabs, this could cause problems where you're told that you do not have a Prefab installed, but visually you appear to have it already
    - This has now been changed so that Package Manager has a separate cache per GM IDE type, and so you will know when a Prefab is/isn't ready in whichever IDE you're currently using
    - For more on this change, see [#10130](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10130)
    - As one example of this problem in past releases, see [#10533](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10533)

- **Package Manager: Added A Preference For Your Default Scope When Opening**
    - The default scope shown in the dropdown when opening Package Manager is now "GM Tools", not "GMRT Beta"
    - However, there is also now a Preference added so you can set this to a scope value of your choice if "GM Tools" is not the one you need most often
    - For more, see [#10298](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10298)

- **Debug Overlay Now Supports Gamepad Control**
    - Added gamepad support into the debug GUI overlays in-game, so now you can interact with a pad as well
    - For more, see [#10572](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10572)

- **Can Now Create Texturepages (And Sprites) At Runtime**
    - Added the ability to create a texturegroup and sprites at runtime from an external sprite sheet
    - `texturegroup_add()` can now be used to create your texturepage and have it ready for loading when you need it
    - `texturegroup_load()` and `texturegroup_unload()` can then be used to manage that
    - For more and a sample project, see [#10367](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10367)

- **`instance_activate/deactivate_region()` Support Excluding/Targeting UI Layers**
    - Added the ability for these two functions to say whether you want to exlude things which are only on a UI Layer when managing the given region
    - For more, see [#10215](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10215)

- **`position_change()` Now Deprecated In Same Manner As `instance_change()`**
    - 2024/13 added `instance_change()` as part of the depracted functions list you have to enable in Game Options > Main if you want to still use them
    - This release sees the similar-usecase `position_change()` added as part of that same checkbox inside Game Options
    - {% include important.html content="If your project uses this function you **will** need to tick this Game Option now, otherwise you will get a code error in-game that it could not be found" %}
    - For a little more, see [#10514](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10514)

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**

## Beta 1 - [IDE 795/Runtime 802 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14%20closed%3A<2025-04-29)  (Apr 29, 2025)

- **IDE Updater: Mac IDE Supported**
    - Although you won't actually see any evidence of this until whenever Beta 2 is released, Mac IDE users can now see and take advantage of the new updates process that's been available on Windows for the last few GameMaker versions
    - You will now get the newer-style updater notifcations and the installer will be downloaded in the background as you use GameMaker
    - Your IDE installation will then be updated on restarting from the dialog/the next time GameMaker is started
    - (Note that of course 2024.13 does not have support for the updater on Mac, so the next Monthly and LTS releases will not show/use the newer updater - it would take over when we release _the one after that_)
    - For more on this IDE updater process, see the manual and also [#10391](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10391)

 - **ProjectTool Updated**
    - A 2024.14.124 version of ProjectTool has also been released in preparation for 2024.1400 Beta 1
    - You will need to install this version in order to be able to use the new Game Option for instance_change(), plus some of the other additions in this release
    - {% include important.html content="If you have any issues opening/importing projects or packages, please ensure you're using this version (or newer) of ProjectTool inside Package Manager and then try again before you submit any bugs!" %}

- **Better DPI Support In The IDE**
    - This release sees the start of a number of improvements to DPI-handling throughout the IDE, especially when moving GameMaker between monitors
    - For more, see [#3196](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3196)
    - Note that there are a number of known issues already reported for button/checkbox sizes now being slightly too large and/or positions being slightly incorrect, so please do check for an existing report before filing minor issues like this
    - However, if you find a serious issue with this functionality that you did not have in 2024.13 (e.g. startup DPI being wildly wrong or moving GameMaker between monitors causes problems), then of course do report these urgently - or comment on any existing issues to say you have the same (send us your Upload a Bug/Sample Package link in your comment)

- **Fixed Lauching GM Via Opening Your Project**
    - Fixed an issue where double-clicking a .yyp file to launch GM could open an empty/blank and unusable GameMaker window on some people's machines
    - For more, see [#10309](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10309) - note that we had a lot of duplicate reports for this one, so you can consider everyone's reports fixed

- **Creating New Projects No Longer Adds The Empty Default Groups In The Asset Browser**
    - Changed the default value for the "Create default groups in new projects" Preference to be OFF, so that the Asset Browser is back to containing only the content that _you_ have created
    - Which means that when creating new projects you will only see the default Room1 that GameMaker always creates for you
    - This communicates more clearly to everyone new to GameMaker that you do not have to create all your sprites in the "Sprites" group, all objects in the "Objects" group, and so on...
    - It does not change the project structure when it's saved out - just that the Asset Browser won't show these unused folders
    - For more, see [#9731](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9731)
    - {% include note.html content="For existing users/GameMaker installations you may need to change the Preference yourself if you want to get this change, as this release will not modify your current Preferences value" %} 

- **Creating New Assets Now Uses Your Feather Preferences For Naming Conventions**
    - Asset Browser has been changed so that now your initial asset names will use the naming values set in your Preferences for Feather
    - This will only take effect if Feather's "Message Severity" value for rule 2017 is _not_ using the default value of "Ignore" (so you may need to change this in Preferences yourself if you want to use this functionality now)
    - For more, see [#10477](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10477)
    - _Note that in Beta 1 this is only a partial implementation and the issue has been reopened for fixes already, but still calling this out as you might see your assets using these new names and wonder why_

- **IDE Now Advises On Startup If YYAL Failed To Load**
    - Fixed an issue on Windows/Mac/Ubuntu where GM would crash on startup when YYAL fails to load for any reason
    - Now, you will get a warning message advising you that this problem happened and a little hint to check your ui.log for any information why and potentially how to fix
    - As this new dialog says, in these situations you can still start GameMaker and edit your project okay, but audio previews will not work in the Sound Editor
    - For more, see [#10222](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10222)
    - Note that this is ultimately why Ubuntu 22 (and various other unsupported distros) stopped working as of 2024.1300 Beta 5, so you may well find GM now launches on those distros again, just with no sound support
    - However, Ubuntu 22 is still classed as unsupported since 2024.13

- **Previewing Sounds In The IDE Is More Accurate**
    - Previewing a sound in the Sound Editor or Inspector now reflects the current Sound Editor settings for that asset
    - This means your options can be heard during the preview inside the IDE and you no longer have to build your game in order to hear the difference after making a change
    - Be aware that this does mean when you're editing the properties of your Sound assets you may trigger that sound to be converted on-demand, so bear in mind that this might cause short delays as this happens  
    - For more, see [#8632](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8632)
    - Be aware also that the UI/UX of many of these Sound Editor/Inspector settings will also be updated in a future 2024.1400 Beta: [#9640](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9640)

- **Output Paths For Streamed Sounds And Audio Groups**
    - Added the ability to specify a path for storing streamed audio files, so they are not in the root folder
    - Controls for this can be found on the Sound Editor/Inspector for an individual sound asset, or on the Audio Groups Editor for all groups other than "default"
    - There are some bits specific to HTML5 that will act differently with these controls, so please do review the issue below or the manual if you have issues when making your changes 
    - For more on all of the above, plus a sample project, see [#2732](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2732)

- **UI Layers Changes**
    - HTML5 is now supported (although there are known issues with this reported already) [#9198](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9198)
    - Added a Preference for your default asset anchor position [#9774](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9774)
    - The Room Editor no longer updates your position coordinates when changing the anchor of an element in a flex panel (but a Preference has also been added to keep the old behaviour if you want) [#9698](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9698)
    - Other than the frequently-reported one in the section below, there are far too many bugs fixed to list here individually, so please see the changelist via the link in the "Beta 1" heading above

- **Fixed UI Layer Drawing On Room Change/Restart**
    - Fixed an issue found in the 2023.13 runtimes where the drawing of elements on the same UI Layer is flipped after changing to a different room
    - This was most-commonly seen when using our blog post's sample game project and its Esc menu's text/button draw order would change
    - For more, see [#10311](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10311) - again, lots of duplicates for this one, so consider all reports fixed
    - Also see the similar-but-opposite-results issues given in [#10474](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10474) and [#10390](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10390) where the draw order using "depth" was incorrect _until_ the room was restarted/changed and then became fixed

- **Code Editor 2 Changes**
    - Lots of bugs have been fixed - especially to do with colouring, tooltips, and F1/MMB to open the correct target
    - As per usual, there are far too many others to list here individually, so please see the changelist via the link in the "Beta 1" heading above

- **Bug-Reporter Changes**
    - Now automatically attaches your project's layout files also if a sample project has been provided by you [#10079](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10079)
    - Enterprise users submitting privately are now shown a much more helpful error dialog while they have not accepted the organisation invite sat waiting on their GitHub profile page, replaces a vague "unprocessable_entity" error dialog shown in earlier IDEs [#9964](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9964)

- **Package Manager Searching Changes**
    - Update package searching to filter by their short description and keywords (although none of the packages have keywords yet)
    - For more, see [#10076](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10076)

- **GX.games Now Supports Transparent Backgrounds**
    - Added support for rendering with a transparent background
    - For more, see [#10305](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10305)
 
- **Android Support For `windowLayoutInDisplayCutoutMode`**
    - Support has been added for slightly older APIs (pre-35) to support edge-to-edge displays when there are cut-outs
    - API 35+ this is always enabled in the Android tools, so this setting only affects older versions
    - For more, see [#8186](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8186)

- **Deprecated `instance_change()`**
    - Added this function to the Deprecated Behaviours section inside Game Options > Main
    - {% include important.html content="If your project uses this function you **will** need to tick this Game Option now, otherwise you will get a code error in-game that it could not be found" %}
    - For more, see [#10299](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10299)

- **Audio Emitter Function Changes**
    - `audio_emitter_gain()` now allows an optional parameter for setting the ramp time, so it matches what `audio_sound_gain()` and `audio_group_set_gain()` have had for a while
    - And the two other functions have had their time parameter made optional, so now all three functions are consistent
    - For more on all of the above, plus a sample project, see [#9386](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9386)

- **Convex Hull Function Changed Since 2024.13**
    - `sprite_get_convex_hull()` can now take the sprite subimage as an additional parameter
    - For more, see [#9784](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9784)

- **Debug GUI Additions**
    - Added several new functions for specifying which view/section a new control is to be added to, confirm if a control exists, and to delete a control
    - Note that this also changed the return values for several other existing dbg_... functions, so bear this in mind as you may need to update your code now
    - For more, see [#10014](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10014)

- **Debug Playback Event Changed Since 2024.13**
    - `debug_input_playback()` in 2024.13 runtimes had names for its map's "type" and "return" keys which do not match standards used in other events
    - Now, the type is called "event_type", per other system events, and the return have has been changed into lowercase and separated by underscores
    - If you have been using this function in 2024.13 you will now need to update your code accordingly
    - For more on all of the above, plus a sample project, see [#10189](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10189)

- **Matrix Function Changes**
    - `matrix_multiply()` has been optimised and also now takes an optional parameter for supplying a premade matrix to reuse
    - For more, plus a sample project showing the before-and-after, see [#10083](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10083)

- **Misc IDE Performance Fixes**
    - Code Editor 2: Causes massive lag when typing anywhere in the IDE after going AFK and then returning [#7203](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7203)
    - Room Editor: "Select Tiles" tool causes a lot of lag after GM has been open for a while [#8830](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8830)

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
