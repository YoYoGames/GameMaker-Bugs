# Original Release (IDE 179/Runtime 226) (17/12/2024)

- **New Windows IDE Updater**
    - Now, you won't actually see much evidence of this one until the _next_ GameMaker release, as there is no newer version to update to right now, but be aware that this release does include the new in-IDE updater for Windows IDE users (not Mac or the Ubuntu Betas!)
    - This new system removes the IDE update notification early on startup and instead moves it to appear when the Start Page has loaded - you can also do an on-demand check from the new Help menu entry
    - At which point, you can ask GameMaker to download the new installer in the background while you continue working if you wish
    - Once the download is ready, GameMaker will ask if you want to restart and silently/automatically install the new version now, or wait and do it the next time you are asked
    - If you choose "Yes" you will see a simple progress bar while the new version is installed for you
    - For more, see [#3157](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3157)

- **Code Editor 2 (Beta) Now Available For Use**
    - This release brings the new code editor to monthly releases for the first time (it's off by default, so you won't see anything unless you enable it in Preferences yourself)
    - Note that the new code editor and its language server are both known to still have a number of outstanding bugs and changes to come, and so you will see it's all marked as a Beta inside GameMaker right now
    - Accordingly, if you do find a bug when using Code Editor 2, please, _please_ do search for existing bug reports and just add comments or thumbs-ups onto those, rather than filing a duplicate report of your own (including closed reports, as they may be only be fixed inside future GM versions that you do not have access to yet!)
    - For a little more on the new code editor, see [#3219](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3219)
    - If you've been using CE2 in the Betas for a while, then be aware the functionality in this release is per the final 2024.1100 Beta

- **Package Manager Now Available For Use**
    - After being in the last few beta versions, the Package Manager is now available in 2024.11
    - Currently this only allows you to load the latest versions of ProjectTool and the IDE Localisation plugins if you need to update any of these
    - However, in current Betas and coming in future non-Beta releases, the Package Manager will also allow you to install Prefabs and packages for building projects with GMRT.

- **Fixes For IDE Stability/Performance/Rendering**
    - Reverted the use of a newer version of the input/rendering libraries, as this should resolve reports of large areas of GameMaker flickering white/black in releases after 2024.2.0 on some AMD GPU laptops which use DPI overrides above 100%
    - Similar issues with flickering/rendering/offsets may well also be fixed now
    - This fixes all of the below:
    - Performance: GM hangs when closing a large number of editor windows at once in a workspace [#7654](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7654)
    - Performance: G-Sync can cause flickering when using GameMaker [#6515](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6515)
    - Performance: Project lag worse in 2024.8 for some affected users than previous releases showed [#7599](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7599)
    - Stability: Large areas of GameMaker flicker white/black in 2024.4.0 on some AMD GPU laptops which use DPI overrides above 100% [#5801](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5801)
    - Startup: FFmpeg crash due to trying to close an already completed thread [#7657](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7657)
    - UI/UX: Toggling fullscreen in a game can cause GameMaker's menubar to become hidden [#6079](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6079)
    - UI/UX: [Win IDE] Tiny black bar flickers at bottom of the GM window since 2024.4 [#6108](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6108)

- **Fixes For RAM Usage Increasing Over Extended Sessions And "Stuttering"**
    - Further to all the performance and stability fixes above, this release should remove a few ways in which you could see GameMaker performing worse over extended sessions of using the IDE
    - This was originally tracked in [#4424](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4424) for the Mac IDE, but various other issues that were reported to us are along similar lines and so were fixed at the same time
    - Be aware also that all changes/fixes in this release apply equally to the Windows/Mac/Ubuntu (Beta) IDEs - it's not Mac-specific
    - If you do still have this problem with increasing RAM usage, please report a new issue rather than commenting on any of the older issues, as we will want the fresh logs and information about your individual machine

- **Support For Not Packaging Unused Assets In Your Export Packages**
    - You can now enable whether during builds GameMaker should automatically ignore any unused assets in your projects, so that these assets are not added into your game packages (the project itself is obviously not modified and the unused assets are safely left alone)
    - Game Options > Main > "Automatically remove unused assets when compiling"
    - Note that this defaults to ON for newly-created projects (off for existing projects), so if you do have any issues when this Game Option is enabled, please do send us a bug report and allow GameMaker to attach your project before you consider turning the feature off again
    - Note that the new Prefabs feature available in Beta IDEs and coming in a future main release will still find all unused assets in the prefabs you're using and ignore them during builds, regardless of whether the Game Option is on or off, as the Game Option only applies to assets inside your own project
    - For more on this new feature, see [#3597](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3597) and for an example of the new logging, see [#8312](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8312)
    - {% include important.html content="If you created a project in any recent IDE starting with 2024.4 your Game Option value will already be ON as well, as GameMaker IDEs have quietly known about this feature for a while - however, the setting won't affect your builds if you're using those older runtimes" %}
    - {% include note.html content="Scribble users: _older_ versions of Scribble always checked all font indexes and so if this setting is enabled Scribble will throw an in-game error when it finds a font is missing - you will need to change this code yourself or update your copy of Scribble ([#8198](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8198))" %}

- **Windows Exports: ARM64 Device Support**
    - You can now create games that target ARM64 Windows devices
    - For Run/Debug, there is no choice you need to make and your game will detect during startup which architecture the target device uses and automatically run the correct runner (i.e. x64 or ARM64)
    - For Create Exe, there are new choices on the packaging type dialog so that  as well as the existing package types, you can now choose to build an ARM64 Zip or an ARM64 NSIS output file as well
    - {% include note.html content="You can use Task Manager to see the architecture of the application and confirm that the ARM64 version is being run on your ARM64 device, but this is a hidden column in the _Details_ window, so you need to enable it yourself in Task Manager first" %}

- **GX.games Exports: .Zip Package Type**
    - Added a new "save as .zip" output type when clicking Create Exe
    - This package type is intended for those who want to use the WASM package that the GX.games target creates for you, but on your own website rather than on the GX Community (and so you have webhosting and a suitable web page already)
    - However, if for some reason you have problems uploading to the GX Community from inside GameMaker when doing a regular Create Exe, then you can use this .zip to send the game that way

- **Game Options: New Controls For Toggling Legacy Behaviours**
    - Added new options for toggling the legacy behaviours for various changes made in 2024.8 and 2024.11, including string-to-number conversion, treatment of "other" (see below), and strict audio errors (also see below)
    - For more, see [#8138](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8138)

- **Game Options: Removed "Generate Mipmaps For Separate Texture Pages"**
    - This Game Option has been redundant for a while, because in recent GameMaker versions you have managed this value in the Texture Groups editor instead
    - Accordingly, the unused Game Option has been removed from the IDE now
    - However, note that any existing value for this setting will be left in your project's source files, just in case for some reason you need to use an older IDE again
    - For more, see [#7045](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7045)

- **Project Load/Room Editor: Filter/Effect Layer Values Are Now Checked For Validity And Fixed Automatically**
    - For situations where you get an in-game error which says "Unknown Function argument 1 invalid reference to (sprite) - requested -1 max is" (like the below issue), we have now determined this is due to invalid values being set in the Room Editor for your filter/effect layer(s)
    - Accordingly, the Room Editor will now detect and fix up these invalid values, as these can have a variety of results in-game
    - However, be aware that you will need to open the room and click on the filter/effect layer(s) that is/are active at this point in your game in order for GameMaker to diagnose the problem - the fix cannot be applied without doing this bit yourself first
    - Building Projects / Project Load: Incorrect values in Dots filter in a room results in draw_sprite() crash in attached project, should catch and fix the filter [#8362](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8362)

- **Audio Functions Now Have Strict Error-Checking And Catch Coding Issues**
    - This release will now more reliably catch when there are errors with audio playback due to invalid assets or arguments, etc., in your code
    - In general, you will want to review these in-game errors and refactor your code to correct the problem, as the error message is there to advise you have _always_ had a problem with your project and that previous runtimes would not have been doing what you were expecting
    - However, `audio_throw_on_error()` has been added also for disabling these stricter checks if you do need to
    - For more info, see [#7285](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7285)

- **Changes To Some In-Game Funtions Which Accept Numbers-As-Strings**
    - json_parse() now throws an error if a string starting with a digit is passed [#8015](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8015)
    - real() now throws errors for strings that start with a number and have trailing characters (e.g., "infobar", "nano", "42 apples") [#7685](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7685)

- **Static Initialisation No Longer Runs Multiple Times**
    - Be aware of this change, as it might require you to refactor your project to maintain compatibility going forward
    - However, we also added a new pragma command for re-enabling the old behaviour, which you can call one time early in your game - `gml_pragma("AllowReentrantStatic", true);` 
    - For more, see [#7888](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7888)

- **matrix_inverse() Added**
    - Added a new function for inverting a matrix which you supply to the function [#2960](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2960)

- **Added support for `script_execute()`/`script_execute_ext()` to call constructors**
    - For more, see [#7995](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7995)

- **Added support for `other` to be the originating `self` when used inside methods**
    - For more, see [#7349](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7349)
 
- **Functions To Minimise/Restore Game Windows On Desktop OSes**
    - `window_minimise()` and `window_restore()` functions have been added for Windows, macOS, and Ubuntu
    - Although, be aware that macOS will not respond to the restore function, as games are paused by the OS when they lose focus
    - For more info, see [#7102](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7102)

- **Decoupled audio-decoding threads from the audio context**
    - For more info, see [#7055](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7055)
    - Also fixes "In-Game: Audio playback no longer cuts sounds off early when using 2028.8 runtimes" [#7597](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7597)

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
