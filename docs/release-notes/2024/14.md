[Milestone Page for 2024.14](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/milestone/27?closed=1)
<br>

2024.14 is the last major release before our new LTS release next year. The initial 2024.14.0 is feature-complete, but as we prepare ourselves for that forthcoming LTS, there will be more 2024.14 updates as the remaining issues intended for the LTS are fixed, as well as to catch any important bugs (not Feature Requests) that are reported as a result of these .14 releases. Therefore, we encourage you to please report any bugs with these releases as soon as possible, so we can fix any issues before the final .14 release.

While these notes cover a lot of the information, this is an extremely large release and contains over 1,100 changes/fixes, so we can't possibly list everything. For the full list of all public issues, please see the Milestone Page link a few lines above here.

We have also worked with the Opera Security Team and external security researchers to locate and resolve several potential vulnerabilities, including CVE-2025-12501 in `network_create_server()`. So, if you use this functionality in your projects we recommend that you update as soon as possible to avoid any potential issues. More information on these security issues can be found [here](https://blogs.opera.com/security).

{% include important.html content="The IDE updater in earlier releases will not update you to 2024.14 - you will need to download the installer using the links above and install the old-fashioned way (if you're not a Steam user, which will of course update you as per usual)." %}

<br>

# Changes To The IDE

- **Welcome Tab**
    - This release adds a quick introduction screen for new users to understand the GameMaker IDE layout more quickly and learn where to find common controls, plus how to open the manual
    - The first time that you open any project in this release you will see the new tab in your workspace area
    - Once you have seen it the first time, it won't reopen again automatically, so you can close the tab once you're done with the information there
    - Should you need to open it again, the Welcome Tab can be opened at any time from the Help menu
    - (Obviously, if you have it open when you close a project it will form part of _that_ project's layout and so will still be there the next time you open that one project, so bear that in mind)

<br>

- **"Readme" Windows On Project Load [#11638](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11638)**
    - Notes in your project can now be set to open their formatted markdown window automatically the first time someone opens a copy of your project
    - For example, if you're developing a tutorial series and you ship .yyz files for your users to follow you could include an offline copy of the tutorial text and images inside the project and know that it would open automatically when the person created their local project
    - If the Note is called "Readme" and is placed in the root of your Asset Browser, then GameMaker will always show it the first time someone opens the project
    - However, you can call your file something else and still click the checkbox to toggle that you would like that Note to show on that first project load
    - Several of our Start Page templates have Readmes that you will see open automatically if you create new projects using them in this IDE, which then helps explain what the template covers and how to work with it

<br>

- **Creating New Projects No Longer Adds The Empty Default Groups In The Asset Browser [#9731](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9731)**
    - Changed the default value for the "Create default groups in new projects" Preference to be OFF, so that the Asset Browser is back to containing only the content that _you_ have created
    - Which means that when creating new projects you will only see the default Room1 that GameMaker always creates for you
    - This communicates more clearly to everyone new to GameMaker that you do not have to create all your sprites in the "Sprites" group, all objects in the "Objects" group, and so on...
    - It does not change the project structure when it's saved out - just that the Asset Browser won't show these unused folders
    - {% include note.html content="For existing users/GameMaker installations you may need to change the Preference yourself if you want to get this change, as this release will not modify your current Preferences value" %} 

<br>

- **Creating New Assets Now Uses Your Feather Preferences For Naming Conventions [#10477](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10477)**
    - Asset Browser has been changed so that now your initial asset names will use the naming values set in your Preferences for Feather
    - This will only take effect if Feather's "Message Severity" value for rule 2017 is _not_ using the default value of "Ignore" (so you may need to change this in Preferences yourself if you want to use this functionality now)
    - Be aware that some asset types (Notes, Extensions, etc.) have Preferences defaults that are intentionally different to all the others, as in many cases you might not want these asset types to confirm to fixed names, etc.
    - Also that "Room1" will always be called "Room1", as that comes from the base project and so already exists

<br>

- **macOS Ventura Support Reinstated [#11623](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11623)**
    - The issue with the audio library has now been resolved and so now users of this old macOS release can use 2024.14

<br>

- **Better DPI Support In The IDE [#3196](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3196)**
    - There are a large number of improvements to DPI-handling throughout the IDE, including when moving GameMaker between monitors
    - Also improves handling of monitors that have different resolutions and DPI settings

<br>

- **Fixed Launching GM Via Opening Your Project**
    - Fixed an issue where double-clicking a .yyp file to launch GM could open an empty/blank and unusable GameMaker window on some people's machines [#10309](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10309)
    - Also, on Mac IDE, fixed that double-clicking a .yyp in Finder would open GM, but not actually load the project [#1084](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/1084)

<br>

- **Warning On Startup If YYAL Failed To Load [#10222](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10222)**
    - In previous releases GM would crash on startup if YYAL failed to load for any reason, but now you will get a warning message advising you that this problem happened and a little hint to check your ui.log for any information why and potentially how to fix the situation yourself right away
    - If this happens on your machine you can still start GameMaker and work on your projects, but audio previews will not work in the Sound Editor

<br>

- **Bug Reporter Changes [All Issues](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A2024.14%20%20in%3Atitle%20"Bug%20Reporter")**
    - There are now minimum character requirements added for the Title and Description fields, so that people stop submitting bug reports consisting of 1 character (no joke...)
    - New categories have been added for “Prefab Bug”, “Extension Bug”, and “ProjectTool Error", the names of several other existing categories have been reworded to better inform how/when you should use them, and "Editing Your Assets" category has been removed, as everyone just used the "IDE" one anyway (and it's identical)
    - Enterprise users submitting privately are now shown a much more helpful error dialog while they have not accepted the organisation invite sat waiting on their GitHub profile page, replaces a vague "unprocessable_entity" error dialog shown in earlier IDEs [#9964](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9964)

<br>

- **Code Editor 1: Fix For Hotkeys Not Working [#10843](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10843)**
    - A number of the non-QWERTY keyboard bug reports for 2024.13 were actually for CE1 specifically and more to do with hotkeys not working
    - This turned out to be the use of custom code snippets and a problem when declaring them, so those users seeing keyboard issues actually had duplicate entries and so the hotkey was being reused - this then caused an error which stopped all remaining hotkeys from being loaded
    - Now, all default hotkeys are loaded and _then_ the custom ones, with new logging and an error dialog shown if your snippets file contains this problem

<br>

- **Code Editor 2/Feather/GmlSpec [All Issues](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A2024.14%20in%3Atitle%20("Code%20Editor%202"%20OR%20"Feather"%20OR%20"GmlSpec"))**
    - There are over 190 issues for these 3 tools, so of course not all of them can be listed here, but the summarised headline changes are:
        - Lots of fixes for the LSP not starting properly when loading your projects
        - Lots of fixes for code-colouring breaking mid-way through lines (e.g., arguments, template strings, piped values)
        - Lots of fixes for autocomplete adding/not adding unwanted indents during some operations, particularly around indentation of braces
        - Fixes for highlighting the correct argument as you're typing a function declaration
        - Several fixes for changes to code files not being saved when their windows are closed, especially if the editor was in a child GameMaker IDE window
        - Feather's "SyntaxErrors" profile is now a little more relaxed and also the IDE no longer forces a Preferences value change for this profile
        - Renaming a collapsed #region can cause its contents to be lost [#11713](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11713)
        - Deleting part of the declaration line for a collapsed function deletes the function's contents also [#11932](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11932)
        - Navbar and Inspector events panels now show @Desc labels for Code events (Visual has an issue and so will come in .14.1) [#8925](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8925)
        - Autocomplete does not appear inside "Execute Code" Visual nodes [#10387](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10387)
        - Converting an event from GML Visual to GML Code doesn't update any refactored code [#11686](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11686)
        - Code Editor 2: Tab and Enter not being able to be rebound cause code completion frustration [#9268](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9268)
            - Note that as well as the new Redefine Keys entries, this one also added a few new Preferences for controlling when the autocomplete appears in CE2, so do see the issue linked above in case you would like to use these new behaviours
    - A note for those who place their opening curly braces on the line below their function/loop declaration lines - you might want to try the "Braces" mode, rather than "Full", and see if this matches more closely what you want the editor to do for you, as "Full" mode is intended to do a lot more and conform to specific popular coding styles which have the braces on the declaration line

<br>

- **Debugger [All Issues](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A2024.14%20in%3Atitle%20"Debugger")**
    - Disabled UI for changing member variable values when real-time debugging is enabled [#11726](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11726)
    - Profiling expensive frames and then stopping profiling no longer causes readouts to become incorrect [#12108](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12108)

<br>

- **Font Editor / Font Support**
    - Fixes have been made for situations where DPI values were still incorrectly being applied to your fonts, so now IDE previews and in-game results are much more accurate; however, be aware that if your project is in this situation already, then you still need to regenerate the font(s) yourself in order to recalculate the desired values now you have this fixed release
    - Fixes these two, for example:
        - Room Editor: Distorted font assets in 2024.1400 Beta 3+, now that other DPI calculations have been changed/fixed [#11042](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11042)
        - In-Game: Room text element measurement can differ from IDE representation [#10893](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10893)
    - GM's own theme fonts used to appear in the list of available fonts, but they are not usable and so have been removed [#7492](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7492)
    - Inspector: [Fonts] Changing properties does not update font at runtime, have to regenerate manually to see a change [#11926](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11926)

<br>

- **Game Options [All Issues](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A2024.14%20in%3Atitle%20"Game%20Options")**
    - Game Options now exports your texture page values as .json files when clicking the Preview button, so this information can be edited manually if you wish and ultimately used in-game later on [#10735](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10735)

<br>

- **Package Manager [All Issues](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A2024.14%20in%3Atitle%20"Package%20Manager")**
    - Installation Cache Is No Longer Shared Between Monthly And Beta IDEs
        - In previous releases, if you downloaded a package/prefab in either of your Beta/Monthly installs, then it would immediately appear in _the other one_ as if it was also installed and ready for use - but it wasn't
        - In the case of Prefabs, this could cause problems where you're told that you do not have a Prefab installed, but visually you appear to have it already
        - This has now been changed so that Package Manager has a separate cache per GM IDE type, and so you will know when a Prefab is/isn't ready in whichever IDE you're currently using
        - For more on this change, see [#10130](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10130)
        - As one example of this problem in past releases, see [#10533](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10533)
    - The default scope shown in the dropdown when opening Package Manager is now "GM Tools", not "GMRT Beta"; however, there is also now a Preference added so you can set this to a scope value of your choice if "GM Tools" is not the one you need most often [#10298](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10298)
    - Added being able to specify via the RMB context menu which packages you want to see update notifications for [#11380](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11380)
    - Similarly, from that same context menu you can now also say which packages should automatically update themselves [#11381](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11381)
    - Added support for enabling/disabling automatic silent updating to newer package versions when they are released, so you can now right-click on packages and toggle this value (by default, no packages are set to auto-update) [#11381](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11381)
    - Expanded package search to support filtering by short description and by keywords (although none of the official packages have keywords yet) [#10076](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10076)
    - And it is now possible to queue multiple different packages at once for installation, and GameMaker will work through the list automatically

<br>

- **Prefab Support**
    - Prefabs Now Allow Editing More Values Directly [#11842](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11842)
        - The logic has been changed so that rather than only a handful of values relating to prefabs can be edited/overridden, now it's all but a specific few can be edited as of this release
        - This means there is less need to duplicate a prefab into your project just so you can change some of its basic values 
    - It is now possible to import and export UI Layers as part of Prefabs [#9782](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9782) for more info

<br>

- **Prefab Library: Duplicate An Entire Collection At Once [#10940](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10940)**
    - Added an option into the content menu so that you can now duplicate the full contents of folders/collections at once, rather than having to add each prefab individually across multiple operations

<br>

- **Project Health Tool**
    - Added warnings for Sounds that are missing their audio file [#9567](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9567)
    - Added warnings for Shaders that are missing either of their vertex/fragment shader files [#9568](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9568)
    - Also fixed that Project Health incorrectly reported files were missing for Sprite Layer Groups in 2024.13 [#9840](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9840)

<br>

- **Project Save/Load**
    - Local Package Integration: Create no longer exports the whole project and not just the stuff that was selected [#12196](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12196)
    - Local Package Integration: Create no longer adds files with same name as folder even if not selected [#11864](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11864)
    - Local Package Integration: Selecting only a Sequence or only a Room to be imported from a local package no longer fails to import because the dependencies are not imported also [#11501](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11501)
    - Local Package Integration: UI layers are always included, even when not selected [#11114](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11114)
    - Prefabs: Importing a YYZ that requires a Prefab Collection no longer stalls the import process [#11753](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11753)
    - Prefabs: Trying to make a prefab object the child of a regular object when that prefab is used in the project no longer causes a project load failure [#10860](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10860)
    - Project Export: Now able to rename a project from the file manager before saving the file [#11196](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11196)
    - Project Export: Projects with non-ascii characters present in filename now export correctly [#9644](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9644)
    - Project Import: YYZs that require a Prefab Collection no longer stall the import process if that Collection cannot be found [#11753](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11753)
    - Project Import: The next successful project load after a failed renamed YYZ import no longer renames the project [#12245](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12245)
    - Project Import: Fixed a GM hang when cancelling opening a .yyz file [#11757](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11757)
    - Project Load: Add a dialog to advise of IDE.cs errors when checking the project's format [#11082](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11082)
    - Project Load: Duplicating prefab into project no longer results in a project that will not load again [#10827](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10827)
    - Project Load: Extension Options are not loaded correctly if this is the first project loaded after starting GameMaker [#9590](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9590)
    - Project Save: Duplicating a Font no longer leaves behind ghost copies of the old font files [#11167](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11167)
    - Project Save: Deleting specific Sprite in attached project no longer causes all future changes to not save and load failures thereafter [#12069](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12069)
    - Project Save: Audio files dragged onto the IDE no longer create two entries [#12315](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12315)
    - Project Save: Duplicating room1 to make room2, editing room2, then duplicating room2 to make room3 no longer causes the changes to room2 not be reflected when running the project [#11908](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11908)
    - Project Save: Importing a Particle System from another project now pulls its dependencies also, no longer corrupts the current project [#11444](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11444)
    - Project Save: SVG images dragged onto the IDE are now added as a vector sprites when requested [#12320](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12320)
    - Project Save: Changing name of instance on a UI Layer no longer causes build fails and project load failure thereafter [#12237](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12237)
    - Project Save: Deleting an Included Files now does not leave a reference in the .yyp [#10778](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10778)
    - Project Save/Load: Deleting an extension function can break loading projects [#10416](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10416)
    - Project Save/Load: Project names containing emojis causes Game Options read errors [#10581](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10581)
    - Sequence Editor: Undo does now works in new Sequences created after duplicating a prefab's Sequence and editing that one [#12263](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12263) / Prefabs: Duplicating the Toggle prefab no longer gives "qToggle was lost and moved to root of project." every time the project is opened thereafter [#12280](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12280)
    - {% include important.html content="If you have any issues opening/importing projects or packages, please ensure you're using this release's "bundled" version (or a newer release) of ProjectTool inside Package Manager and then try again **before** you submit any bugs!" %}

<br>

- **Room Editor [All Issues](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A2024.14%20in%3Atitle%20"Room%20Editor")**
    - Performance fix for Tile editing [#10710](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10710) (and there were several older/newer duplicates of this one, so all have been closed by this fix)
        - Now, in most cases you will not see any delays, but be aware of you are selecting and copy/pasting hundreds of tiles at once there is of course still some small amount of lag
    - UI Layer prefabs dropped onto a different layer type now trigger the usual dialog asking if you want to make a new layer of the correct type and add the prefab onto that [#11094](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11094)
        - Matches the functionality that other assets (Objects requiring an Instance layer, Sprites and Sequences requiring an Asset layer, etc.) have had for a long time
    - You can now double-click an instance within the Room Editor and change which Sprite is assigned to this instance [#3733](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3733)
        - This means you can now better preview and position assets in your room
        - These sprite values are also then used as the sprite_index upon game start
    - Added the ability into the UI Layers functionality for resizing Flexpanels via mouse [#9699](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9699)
        - This support covers canvas resizing, reordering, and margin/padding adjustment
    - Added support for autotiling to allow tile 0 to be used as a blank tile [#12146](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12146)
        - This ultimately works exactly the same as always, but now you can use the 0 tile rather than having to ensure you had a blank tile in your set

<br>

- **Sound Editor/Inspector [All Issues](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A2024.14%20in%3Atitle%20"Sound%20Editor")**
    - Improved the clarity Of Editor/Inspector functionality [#9640](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9640)
        - A number of the settings shown for sounds have now been renamed so they're clearer about what they will result in
        - At the same time, several of the Inspector gadgets have been reordered/collapsed into dropdowns rather than radioboxes, and also settings that are made redundant by others are now enabled/disabled accordingly
        - There is also a new section for showing the output size of your sound, based on the settings you have currently chosen - and this information can be collapsed/expanded and even copied to the clipboard for use elsewhere
        - All of this does mean that if you change the audio file used by a sound, or you pick a new setting which would make a material difference to its output, the sound will be processed immediately and all of the values will be updated with the new results - depending on the size of the audio file, this can obviously take a few seconds, and so you will see the values blank out and a spinner appears while the sound file is being built
        - Also, if your Sound is missing a source audio file the info box will make this much clearer now
    - Previewing a sound in the Sound Editor or Inspector now reflects the current Sound Editor settings for that asset [#8632](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8632)
        - This means your options can be heard during the preview inside the IDE and you no longer have to build your game in order to hear the difference after making a change
        - Be aware that this does mean when you're editing the properties of your Sound assets you may trigger that sound to be converted on-demand, so bear in mind that this might cause short delays as this happens  
    - Added the ability to specify a path for storing streamed audio files, so they are not in the root folder [#2732](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2732)
        - Controls for this can be found on the Sound Editor/Inspector for an individual sound asset, or on the Audio Groups Editor for all groups other than "default"
        - There are some bits specific to HTML5 that will act differently with these controls, so please do review the issue below or the manual if you have issues when making your changes 
    - Note that this release also fixes a few issues when loading Sound assets in projects:
        - Inspector: [Sound] Previewing very short audio files now always sets the button states correctly [#10256](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10256)
        - Project Save: GM no longer crashes in ConvertAudio when converting a large number of files dragged onto the IDE at the same time [#10602](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10602)
        - Project Load: Fixed a GM crash during ConvertAudio which stopped projects from loading [#10608](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10608)
        - Stability: Fixed a PurgeAudio crash due to file lock [#10445](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10445)

<br>

- **SVGs: Import Animations As Frames [#10193](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10193)**
    - The sprite editor will now import animations within an SVG image and save them as separate frames inside the Sprite Editor, so then you can see and use all of the animation contained in that image file just the same as you would a PNG-based Sprite

<br>

- **UI Layers**
    - Added a Preference for your default asset anchor position [#9774](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9774)
    - The Room Editor no longer updates your position coordinates when changing the anchor of an element in a flex panel (but a Preference has also been added to keep the old behaviour if you want) [#9698](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9698)
    - Fix for instances on UI Layers being moved when reordering layers [#11700](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11700)

# Changes To GMS2/GMRT Runtimes

{% include important.html content="GMRT Users: 2024.14 does not support 0.16.5 and older - see [the 0.18 release notes](https://releases.gamemaker.io/release-notes/2025/GMRT_ms_18) for all the info." %}

Always confirm you're using the correct tools for this release! You can find the Required SDKs wiki link at the top of this page.

- **Building Projects: More AssetCompiler And Igor Errors Are Highlighted During Builds [#10654](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10654)**
    - A number of errors and warnings that these two tools wrote to your Output window log were not using the correct formatting to make the IDE also show the lines in the Compiler Errors panel for ease of finding them later
    - Now, these logging messages have all been standardised and will now show up correctly
    - This may of course mean that an error you never knew you had is suddenly showing - this is correct and something for you to rectify in your project or tools setup
    - Additionally, if you are using any form of build automation you may need to account for seeing these errors / change any code you had that detected the old error messages

<br>

- **Audio Error Suppression Now Expanded To Account For Coding Problems Also [#10198](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10198)**
    - Audio errors have always been shown when the game legitimately fails to find a source file (such as having newlines in the string used as the filename and passing this string to `audio_create_stream()`)
    - Now, these can be suppressed by the two existing methods for "hiding" audio errors in the output log only

<br>

- **Debug Overlays**
    - Added gamepad support into the debug GUI overlays in-game, so now you can interact with a pad as well [#10572](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10572)
    - Added ability to toggle whether or not you want gamepad support, but also if you want only one specific gamepad to interact or to allow all pads [#11705](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11705)
    - Added 2 new optional params to `show_debug_overlay()` to facilitate this
        - Now it's `show_debug_overlay(enable,[minimised],[scale],[alpha],[gamepad_enable],[gamepad_index]...)`
        - "gamepad_enable" can be true or false (default is true) and controls allowing gamepad input
        - "gamepad_index" is either -1 (default) for allowing all gamepads or you can specify the gamepad index to limit interactions to (e.g., player 1 only)
    - The new function `dbg_get_gamepad_input()` will return a real number to show the status of gamepad input in the debug overlay
        - A return of -1 indicates gamepad input is disabled
        - A return of -3 indicates gamepad input is enabled for all gamepads
        - Any other number indicates that only _that_ specific gamepad is allowed for debug overlay input
    - Also added several new functions for specifying which view/section a new control is to be added to, confirm if a control exists, and to delete a control [#10014](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10014)
        - Note that this also changed the return values for several other existing dbg_... functions, so bear this in mind as you may need to update your code now

<br>

- **Extensions: macOS YYC Now Has Support For Inserting Frameworks Into Your Builds [#10429](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10429)**
    - You can now create a "MacFrameworks" folder in your project source and any Framework .zip files in here will be added automatically during your macOS YYC builds
    - Note that this is supported on YYC only

<br>

- **Gamepad Mappings Fixes And Updated Database**
    - For this 2024.14, the gamepad mapping database has been updated also, so you should find more pads work better than ever; however, it's worth testing this change well in your gamepad code - especially if you already have custom mappings being set by your game
    - Mapping for any button/axis which use a +/- sign before it is now handled correctly and so your input will be detected properly [#8933](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8933) and [#11574](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11574)
    - On all desktop platforms, Nintendo Switch gamepads connected via USB have now been filtered from the list of gamepad devices [#8426](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8426)
    - And on macOS, the mapping for a certain Xbox 360 controller has been fixed so now it works like all other 360 pads (specifically model GUID 030000005e0400008e02000014010000) [#12109](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12109)

<br>

- **post_textures.bat Now Accesses More Environment Variables [#12008](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12008)**
    - Previously, this batch file did not support a number of GM's environment variables - now, it is able to do so

<br>

- **Primitive-Drawing Fixes, Plus Support For "Legacy" Values [#11062](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11062)**
    - On all targets there has always been a little compatibility tweak so that DirectX 11 in GM/GMS2 looks the same as GM: Studio 1.x (DirectX 9) did and maintain long-time compatibility within GM - which unfortunately meant the primitive functions could draw the positions off by one pixel in some cases / on some targets
    - This tweak is no longer performed as standard
    - However, to control this, a new Game Options "deprecated behaviours" checkbox has been added also - this defaults to ON when opening existing projects and OFF for all new projects created as of this release
        - When OFF, the values will be passed through as un-modified as possible - be aware some OpenGL targets (Ubuntu, Consoles) still always require a small automatic tweak to their values
        - When ON this will restore the old tweaked values, should you need to maintain consistency

<br>

- **Rooms/Sequences Support Persistent Alignment Values For Text Instances**
    - Added support for text instances to have persistent alignment in-game
    - This is done via a combination of changed/new gadgets in the Room Editor/Sequence Editor, plus the new `layer_text_origin()`
    - This function can be used with a range of new `origin_...` constants for standard values like topleft, bottomright, etc., to set the origin for a text instance
    - And `layer_text_get_origin()` can be used to get which constant is in effect for a given instance
    - For more, including a sample .yyz file which shows the new functionality, see [#11637](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11637)
    - Also fixes the below issue:
        - In-Game: Non-wrapped text instances ignore their alignment values [#10455](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10455)

<br>

- **Spine Pre-Multiplied Alpha Control Functions Added [#12070](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12070)**
    - A change was made earlier for 2024.14 that would automatically set the appropriate blend mode to correctly draw Spine sprites that use pre-multiplied alpha, as long as the current blend mode is set to the default (if the blend mode is set to anything else it's assumed that you have set it for a reason).
    - However, there have been some projects submitted throughout the Beta period that this does not work well for, and so we've added a couple of functions to disable this again:
        - `draw_enable_skeleton_blend_override(enable)` - "true" enables the override (new behaviour) and "false" to use the previous behaviour. (The default setting is true.)
        - `draw_get_enable_skeleton_blend_override()` - returns true/false if the override is enabled or not.

<br>

- **SWF/SVG: Performance Changes And New Functions For Controlling Memory Usage [#11624](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11624)**
    - Now, on most platforms (all except PS4, PS5 and HTML5), the drawing of SWF and SVG sprites is accelerated by caching them in vertex buffers first before drawing them. This trades reduced CPU load from manually transforming vertices and calculating anti-aliasing data each frame with an increased number of draw calls.
    - In general, this is a large win; however, the amount of cache memory used for this new method is something you can control via the use of several new `vector_sprite_cache_...()` functions that have been added in this release
    - You can query the amount of cache usage at any time
    - Cached items will be automatically pruned when reaching an age value you set, plus you can control the rate of pruning these old items once they reach your chosen age
    - Any sprites which attempt to draw when there is not enough of this new cache available will still draw fine - they will simply do so using the regular method that's been used for all GMS2 runtime releases until now
    - And, if you want, you can turn the new method off and continue using the standard method instead by simply setting the cache limit to 0

<br>

- **Texture Pages (And Sprites) Can Now Be Created At Runtime**
    - Added the ability to create a texture group and sprites at runtime from an external sprite sheet
        - `texturegroup_add()` can now be used to create your texture page and have it ready for loading when you need it [#10367](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10367)
            - The format to use can be found on the issue or in the manual
            - Also allows passing premade buffers instead of filenames [#12084](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12084)
        - `texturegroup_load()` and `texturegroup_unload()` can then be used to manage that
        - `texturegroup_exists()` checks whether a specified texture group exists or not [#10919](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10919)
        - `texturegroup_delete()` deletes it again when you're done with that group [#10678](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10678)
    - Also fixed that `texturegroup_add()` used to allow multiple texture groups to be added with the same name [#10921](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10921)

<br>

- **UI Layers**
    - HTML5 is now supported by all the UI Layers functionality [#9198](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9198)
    - Fixed an issue found in the 2023.13 runtimes where the drawing of elements on the same UI Layer is flipped after changing to a different room [#10311](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10311) (_lots_ of duplicates for this one, so consider all reports fixed)
        - This was most-commonly seen when using our blog post's sample game project and its Esc menu's text/button draw order would change
    - Also see the similar-but-opposite-results issues given in [#10474](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10474) and [#10390](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10390) where the draw order using "depth" was incorrect _until_ the room was restarted/changed and then became fixed
    - And also fixed that calling room_goto() and leaving a persistent room broke UI Layer drawing in the next room [#10677](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10677)
    - "mouse_x" and "mouse_y" for instances on UI Layers now use GUI co-ords rather than regular layer co-ords [#11678](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11678)
    - Added two new custom measurement functions [#7419](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7419):
        - `flexpanel_node_set_measure_function(node, function)` adds the given function to the node, and when a layout is calculated and a measurement is required the given GML function will be called with the parameters "width", "widthType", "height", "heightType" (see Yoga's documentation) and then return a struct containing the calculated width and/or height
        - `flexpanel_node_get_measure_function(node)` gets the measure function for a given node
        - These two expose existing Yoga functionality for manipulating your UI at runtime
    - Objects on UI Layers now execute their Create events [#10629](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10629)
    - UI Layers no longer break depth-sorting for Instance Layers below it in the room [#10390](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10390)

<br>

## Target-Specific Support Changes

- **Console SDK Versions Updated**
    - If you're an Xbox or Switch developer, then be aware you will need to use a newer SDK version as of this GameMaker release
    - Please see the console's own setup wiki page for the specifics
    - {% include important.html content="Please ensure you're using the correct SDK version _and_ you have updated your console firmware to match, then clean your cache and then try building again before you submit any bugs!" %}

<br>

- **Android**
    - Google Play requires all submissions as of Nov 2025 to use 16kb-aligned page sizes - this release adds that support [#10894](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10894)

    - Extensions no longer pass in "self"/"other" as arguments [#12187](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12187)
    - Resolution-updating code in Alarms/Time Sources now works reliably, so your code for this doesn't have to be in Step events [#11844](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11844)
    - Attempting to go fullscreen on older iOS 15.8 and older no longer throws an exception [#11891](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11891)
    - Arrow Key presses are now detected [#10487](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10487)

- **PlayStation 5**
    - You can now enable Low-Energy Mode in your games and it will be supported on the console (defaults to ON if you create a new project or param.sfo file)

<br>

- **Ubuntu**
    - Fixed enumeration of mice as if they are gamepads [#9250](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9250)

<br>

- **Windows** 
    - Re-Added Support For Legacy DXGI_SWAP_EFFECT_DISCARD [#11489](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11489)
        - Windows 11's "optimisations for windowed games" can cause issues for games which use transparency extensions and other graphical tricks
        - Accordingly, there is now a new Game Option added for enabling the legacy swap chain that GameMaker has used in the past, which will not get these OS optimisations automatically applied
        - This should allow your extensions to work again as they did in previous GM releases (however, we cannot prevent further changes in Windows itself causing future issues here) 
    - Some machines can see issues when losing focus, which can then cause timing functions to go wrong, so the new `display_set_timing_method(tm_countvsyncs_winalt)` constant and timing method has been added to help mitigate this situation
        - You can now call this function and set the method early in your game startup and see if this resolves any issues on your player's machine  
        - Using this timing method also fixes "delta_time breaks when the game window loses focus on some machines" [#11562](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11562)
    - Removed Requirement For Windows Media Pack (Where Possible) [#11965](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11965)**
        - Windows N users do not have Windows Media Pack installed by default as part of their OS install, but up until now games would not run unless the pack was installed first
        - YYC builds no longer include this requirement by default (VM still does!)
        - Instead, YYC only requires it for those which play videos - as it is the video playback functionality which introduced this requirement
    - Not having a splash screen set in Game Options resulted in a flash of a white screen during load, so this has been fixed now [#12165](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12165)
    - Mouse release status is now correct after pressing via touchscreen [#11464](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11464)

## Functions Added/Changed/Removed/Fixed

- **Misc. New Functions**
    - The following smaller functions have been added to fill holes in existing functionality areas - for each of these you can find all of their info in the manual already:
    - `application_surface_is_draw_enabled()`
    - `keyboard_virtual_set_position()`
    - `layer_particle_get_id()` and `layer_particle_get_instance()`
    - `layer_tilemap_set_colmask()` and `layer_tilemap_get_colmask()` [#12177](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12177)
    - `sphere_is_visible()` [#11563](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11563)

<br>

- **Deprecated `instance_change()` and `position_change()`**
    - Added these functions to the Deprecated Behaviours section inside Game Options > Main
    - {% include important.html content="If your project uses any of these functions you **will** need to tick the required Game Option now, otherwise you will get a code error in-game that it could not be found" %}
    - For more, see [#10299](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10299), [#10514](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10514)

<br>

- **Misc. Function Changes**
    - `array_delete()` being passed indexes past the end of the array has gone back to showing a code error for this [#11967](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11967)
    - `array_push()` now behaves like the array is a growable list [#3022](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3022)
    - `audio_emitter_gain()` now allows an optional parameter for setting the ramp time, so it matches what `audio_sound_gain()` and `audio_group_set_gain()` have had for a while [#9386](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9386)
        - And the two other functions have had their time parameter made optional, so now all three functions are consistent
    - `code_is_compiled()` is now a compile-time function [#11234](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11234)
    - `debug_input_playback()` in 2024.13 runtimes had names for its map's "type" and "return" keys which do not match standards used in other events [#10189](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10189)
        - Now, the type is called "event_type", per other system events, and the return have has been changed into lowercase and separated by underscores
        - If you have been using this function in 2024.13 you will now need to update your code accordingly
    - `flexpanel_node_style_set_max_height()` is now able to reset "max_height" to none/auto [#11274](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11274)
    - `game_restart()` now resets IDE-created UI Layers to expected values (note that ones you create at runtime remain unchanged and you must manage this yourself) [#10134](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10134)
    - `instance_activate/deactivate_region()` can now exclude things which are only on a UI Layer when managing the given region [#10215](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10215)
    - `matrix_build/get/inverse()` and `matrix_transform_vertex()` all now take an optional parameter for supplying a premade array to reuse [#10503](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10503)
    - `matrix_multiply()` has been optimised and also now takes an optional parameter for supplying a premade matrix to reuse [#10083](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10083)
    - `sprite_get_convex_hull()` can now take the sprite subimage as an additional parameter [#9784](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9784)
    - `string()` has been optimised in the compiler [#11689](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11689)
    - `timeline_index` now uses refs instead of numbers [#11474](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11474)

# Changes To Templates, Plugins, Packages, And Prefabs

- **Templates: Description Changes For Blank Project Templates And Fixes For Older Runtimes**
    - Updated the descriptions for the two "Blank game" and "Blank pixel game" templates to clarify the differences between them and when you might want to pick one versus the other [#10233](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10233)
    - Also released fixed/updated versions of a number of templates which received recent releases that did not work in 2024.13-or-older runtimes [#10053](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10053)
    - And all of the following are fixed:
        - [Idle][HTML5]: Fixed wrong weapon being unlocked [#9889](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9889)
        - [Match 3 Visual]: Fixed code error when moving doughnuts [#11488](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11488) 
        - [Windy Woods] [Ubuntu/macOS]: Fixed case-specific “Collisions” script silently failing to import [#11475](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11475)
    - However, if you have already previously downloaded any of these projects, be aware that you need to delete your downloaded package from GameMaker's settings folder and then download the new version again by creating a new project on the Start Page (alternatively, you can just apply the coding fixes given in #10053 yourself)

<br>

- **IDE Updater Changes [All Issues](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A2024.14%20in%3Atitle%20"IDE%20Updater")**
    - Note that the updater which is included in the 2024.13 release has the old name and is not suitable for updating to 2024.14
    - Named the executable something safer-sounding and more identifiable as a GameMaker tool than the old name of "WindowsAutoUpdater" [#10805](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10805)
    - Mac IDE users will now see the newer-style update notifications appearing over the Start Page and you can download the installer while you work, apply it when you're ready, etc.
        - (Note that of course 2024.13 does not have support for the updater on Mac, so 2024.13 won't show any changes - assuming you update to 2024.14.0, the changes will start appearing whenever an updated 2024.14 is released)

{% include important.html content="The IDE updater in earlier releases will not update you to 2024.14 - you will need to download the installer using the links above and install the old-fashioned way (if you're not a Steam user, which will of course update you as per usual)." %}

<br>

- **ProjectTool Changes [All Issues](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20milestone%3A2024.14%20in%3Atitle%20"ProjectTool")**
    - There are quite a number of project format/Game Options changes since 2024.13, so please be aware that you need to be set to the correct version inside Package Manager, otherwise you will continue to have the old issues
    - The correct version of ProjectTool is bundled with this IDE install and so in the majority of cases you should be set to use this automatically inside Package Manager; however, if you have previously manually installed ProjectTool versions yourself, then yours may be set to use a different older version and this will continue to be obeyed - if so, simply _Uninstall_ your current version and then GameMaker will immediately use this new one
    - Remember that if you need to take projects between this 2024.14 release and Betas/LTS you will likely need to download this version of ProjectTool from Package Manager _in those GameMaker installs_ before they will be able to open your projects
    - Note also that as of this release you will only see the ProjectTool package relevant for the OS you're using (e.g., you won't be shown the Mac or Ubuntu package when you're using a Windows PC)
    - See the Package Manager changes section above to find how to set Package Manager to notify you and/or auto-update ProjectTool in future

{% include important.html content="Again, if you have any issues opening/importing projects or packages, please ensure you're using this release's "bundled" version (or a newer release) of ProjectTool inside Package Manager and then try again **before** you submit any bugs!" %}
