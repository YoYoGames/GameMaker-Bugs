# 2024.14 Monthlies

[Required SDKs Wiki Page for 2024.14](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/wiki/2024.14)

<br>

2024.14 is a range of separate point-releases (.0/.1/etc.) as we expand 2024.14 to eventually become LTS 2026.0. So, rather than have every 2024.14 release on one _truly enormous_ page that becomes hard to read, you will find the correct release notes for the specific point-release that you are using via the links below.

<br>

We **strongly** recommend using the latest release at all times, so treat the notes for older versions as legacy info.

If you _are_ using an older version and you encounter a bug, always update to the latest version and check the bug still happens **before** reporting anything to us.
