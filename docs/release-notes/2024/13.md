# 2024.13 - Current Version: IDE 193/Runtime 242 

Download Links: [Windows](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2024.13.1.193.exe) - [macOS](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-2024.13.1.193.pkg) - [Ubuntu (Betas Only)](https://releases.gamemaker.io/release-notes/2024/1300)

_Note that this is a very large release since 2024.11 and there are well over 500 closed issues in the [public milestone changelist](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/milestone/25?closed=1) - accordingly, not everything will be listed in these release notes. Please do see the changelist if you have specific fixes you're waiting for or need more information on why something in your project may be behaving differently as of this release._

_Also be aware that system audio beeps inside GameMaker have been disabled for Mac IDE users in this release, due to [#10022](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10022)._


# .1 Update - 2024.13.1 (IDE 193/Runtime 242) [Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/milestone/28?closed=1)  (Apr 17, 2025)

A small, but very important update to fix a number of the top issues reported after the original release. A lot of the changes are listed below anyway, but do see the changelist linked above for the full details.

- **Headline Changes**
    - Building Projects: [HTML5] 2024.13.0 runtimes fail to build projects containing global scripts or Game End events [#10258](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10258)

 - **ProjectTool Updated**
    - A newer "2024.14." version of ProjectTool has also been released in preparation for 2024.1400 Betas starting soon. If you had any issues opening your projects in 2024.13.0 or 2024.11 after editing them in 2024.13, then you can update to this version by using Package Manager.


# Original Release - 2024.13.0 (IDE 190/Runtime 238)  (Apr 8, 2025)

## IDE Features And Changes

- **UI Layers (For All Targets Other Than HTML5)**
    - Building on the flexpanels feature introduced in 2024.11 runtimes, you can now create dedicated UI layers inside the Room Editor and lay out all of your assets in a visual manner
    - These layers are global and persist throughout rooms, so you only need to set up a layer once and then you can use it in whichever rooms require it
    - The layers scale to fit your game windows and because they are in UI space they will be shown above any black bar areas surrounding your game's application_surface 
    - Assets on UI Layers can then be manipulated in-game using the existing runtime functions - and a new function has been added so that you can query if a given asset is present on a UI Layer or not
    - For more information see [#3159](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3159)
    - Note that the issue above also has downloadable examples for a range of different UIs you might wish to make in your own game (front end with highlighted text, linked pause menus, settings menus, level-select screens, and more), so do check out these sample projects and see how this powerful new feature can be used
    - {% include important.html content="As that issue linked above says, 2024.13 does not support UI Layers on HTML5 - that functionality is coming in 2024.14" %}

- **Marketplace Integration Has Been Removed**
    - Be aware that there is now no way of managing your Marketplace library and instead the Marketplace website will simply allow you to download the files for the assets you have aceess to
    - Similarly, uploading new versions of assets you have published is all now done via your web browser, not inside GameMaker itself
    - Accordingly, you will find that all relevant menu options are either removed or now simply open the correct URL in your OS's default browser
    - For more, see [#9304](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9304)
    - Also be aware of these "extra" bits that are to do with Marketplace functionality, but appear elsewhere in the IDE:
    - Startup: GM no longer downloads your asset manifest, which stops a Mac IDE crash when a VPN blocks traffic to the Marketplace and causes a "403 Forbidden" error [#9906](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9906)
    - Asset Browser: Removed "Add Existing from My Library" [#9907](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9907)

- **"Project Health" Checks For Missing Sprites In Your Project**
    - Added a dialog to warn when GameMaker finds a Sprite's source images have been removed on disk, but the Sprite is still in the Asset Browser and part of your project
    - This has always appeared as a red X image inside GameMaker, but this quiet warning could lead to confusion where in-game you might not easily realise why a sprite is not being drawn - now, you will be much more clearly advised when opening the project exactly which files are missing
    - Note that it's only Sprites which are checked in this way
    - For more, see [#6749](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6749)
 
- **Prefab Library**
    - You can now enable the new Prefab Library and import our intitial batch of Prefabs into your projects. This feature was previously only avalable in the Beta releases 
    - Prefabs are complete, standalone projects which help you quickly add more content into your games (like characters, sound packs, or gameplay mechanics/libraries, etc.)
    - You can drag prefabs from your library and drop them into the Room/Sequence/Object Editor to link them to your project and use them right away - using this method the source files for the prefab are not added to your project’s own source, but instead are pulled in during builds and added into your game packages
    - Or you can right-click the item and duplicate something from a prefab collection into your project - using this method copies the prefab source into your own project’s source and breaks the link to the original prefab, stopping it from using any later versions, but allowing you to now edit the files in your project
    - Open the Library inside your project by clicking “Windows > Prefab Library” and this will open the new bottom dock panel
    - Prefabs are then downloaded (once) using its Package Manager integration and then added to any of your projects thereafter from your library
    - For more on this feature, see [#4681](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4681)

- **SVG Support Introduced**
    - This release now supports SVG graphics in the IDE and in-game. This feature was previously only available in the Beta releases
    - You can now import and preview some SVG images, then this will carry through to your game at build time
    - See these issues for details - [#5895](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5895) / [#8276](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8276) / [#8275](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8275) / [#8274](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8274)

- **Game Options Default Value Changes**
    - Currently all product/display names are set as "Created in Gamemaker" which, while true, is not a great name for _your_ game.
    - This also leads to issues if you do not update this value in Game Options before releasing your content - for example, GX.Games uploads will fail as the name is already taken [#8939](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8939), and creating and running an installer on some platforms will leave it with an unhelpful folder name "Created In Gamemaker"
    - Now, it's the _initial_ name of your project that is used when creating your Game Options the first time (so if you later rename your project you should still edit these values yourself)
    - For more information see [#8291](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8291)
    - Also, be aware that the default value of Windows' "Interpolate colours between pixels" setting is now ON, so it matches what the manual has long said and is the same as all the other targets [#2343](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2343)

- **Code Editor 2 and Feather Fixes**
    - This is just a small and not-sorted-at-all sample of the bigger changes or most-commonly-reported issues - there are a **lot** of other fixes for CE2 listed in the changelist, so please see the link higher up if you need information on a specific issue
    - Added a Preference for Ctrl+K to always add comment characters at the start of the top line, not at current selection location [#8869](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8869)
    - New files are now highlighted when creating them inside large projects [#9456](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9456)
    - Renaming a shader makes it not save until closed and reopened [#9488](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9488)
    - Auto-indent no longer adds unwanted indents to user-made snippets containing newlines [#9168](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9168)
    - Snippets now convert any tabs in their whitespace according to your Preferences setting for the tab character [#9545](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9545)
    - Sticky headers no longer disappear when scrolling up in the editor [#9469](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9469)
    - Keyword.Operator colour value in Preferences is now applied correctly in the editor (note that you do need to click "Reset To Defaults" to pick up this fix) [#9420](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9420)
    - Can now open GML Visual events from the Inspector panel [#9239](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9239)
    - "Automatically reload changed files" setting now works correctly [#9230](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9230)
    - Fixed issues with ncorrect syntax highlighting and no autocomplete after converting from visual to GML [#8531](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8531) / [#9132](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9132)
    - Jumping to a code line via bookmark, ctrl + z, or feather message now accounts for sticky headers [#8877](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8877)
    - Bookmark visuals are no longer lost when closing and opening a script or event [#8589](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8589)
    - Enabling ligatures no longer makes code wider [#8397](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8397)
    - Markdown in tooltips has now been made much more functional [#8582](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8582)
    - Stopped GM going unstable when scrolling the events for certain Objects in the Scrolling Shooter template [#9039](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9039)
    - Changes are now auto-saved when you switch to another Object [#8880](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8880)
    - {% include important.html content="If you have changed your Code Editor 2 theme Preferences in previous versions, be aware you may encounter [#9048](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9048), where selected text is not visible because the highlight is fully opaque. Should you encounter this, you will need to reset your theme settings to fix the problem. See the issue comments for more advice." %}

- **Startup Changes To When The Matching Runtime Is Required When Newer Runtimes Are Installed Also**
    - Going forward, GameMaker will no longer force installing the matching runtime for an IDE release if a newer runtime is active and which matches at least the first 2 parts of the version number, but has a higher third/fourth part
    - This means if you install this GameMaker IDE and allow it to get its matching runtime 730, whenever we release a newer 2024.1300.0.731+ runtime you could install that one and set it active instead, then (if you wished) delete runtime 730 manually to save disk space
    - Again, to be clear, the newer runtime must be from the same "family" as the IDE version - having a "2024.1400" runtime (or whatever) will still not be accepted by this 2024.1300 IDE and it would download its matching runtime again for you
    - For more, see [#5927](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5927)

- **Inspector Support For The "Extension Options" Panel In Extensions**
    - You can now inspect the options for your extensions
    - Only the options have been implemented, as these are the per-project settings that the _users_ of an extension will need to set quickly and easily
    - If you're the _developer_ of an extension, this also means your own values are safely still in the Extension Editor and less likely to be accidentally modified
    - For more, see [#5345](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5345)
 
- **Bug Reporter Tweaks**
    - Made the private attachments section an actual boxed/grouped section, so we can avoid misinterpretations [#8398](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8398)
    - If you're at all unsure how GameMaker sends reports to us, what's private and what's public, and how to find the known issues and other information that can help you fix any install issues straight away, _please_ click the link on how to report a bug at the top of the bug-reporter window, as this FAQ has everything you need
    - Also now sends the GMRT package version when submitting a GMRT Bug report, rather than sending the GMS2 runtime version [#8583](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8583)
    - {% include note.html content="If you're seeing 'Unauthorised' errors, please sign out and in again inside GameMaker and this will likely fix straight away - [#9473](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9473)" %}

- **“Default Audio Device” Preference Has Been Removed**
    - The preference to pick a default audio device in GameMaker has been removed
    - The IDE follows the system’s preference
    - For more info see [#9256](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9256)
 
- **Debugger Fixes**
    - If an event only has a single line of code, "step into function" no longer occasionally steps through multiple instances at once [#9924](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9924)
    - "layer" Locals variable now shows its correct value, rather than always showing as 0 [#9923](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9923)
    - Flexpanel node references can now be expanded as a struct (this will display non-default values only) [#6837](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6837)
    - Macros cause the wrong line to be selected when stepping into/over lines which use them [#8971](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8971)

- **Hotkeys are now separate plugins**
    - Hotkeys/Keyboard Shortcuts are now being delivered as individual plugins
    - Your Hotkeys are now also localised to the language you set in GameMaker
    - There are no other changes to the user experience and the plugins are still getting installed during GameMaker’s installation process

- **Other IDE Changes To Be Aware Of**
    - Asset Browser: Now immediately shows the expected new assets even if Prefab Library "Duplicate to project" operation or "Add Existing" needed to create a new group to put those assets in [#8566](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8566) / [#9522](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9522)
    - Building Projects: [GX.games] Fixed that uploading a game to the GXC could fail with an "Incorrect Data" message if your session token had not refreshed correctly - now, GM detects if the token failed to refresh properly and will show a message that you need to sign out and in again to fix [#7464](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7464)
    - Code Editor: [Mac/Ubu IDE] Keyboard shortcuts now work reliably when using specific non-Roman language keyboard layouts [#953](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/953)
    - Code Editor: Deprecated the constants for unsupported devices "os_uwp", "os_psvita", "os_ps3", "os_win8native", "os_winphone", "os_xboxone" [#9192](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9192)
    - Configurations: GPU Texture Compression options are now saved and compiled correctly even when using any config other than "Default" [#9474](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9474)
    - Code Editor 1: Now prioritises existing code workspaces when reopening a Script in the Asset Browser, rather than opening a chained window [#9247](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9247)
    - Device Manager: [HTML5] Now able to detect new versions of Opera GX [#9106](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9106)
    - File Watcher: Deleting a recently-pasted instance which has creation code no longer triggers the watcher [#7493](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/7493)
    - Game Options: [iOS] Removed the check that icons need an alpha channel, as Apple no longer requires this [#9175](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9175)
    - Go To: GM no longer crashes when pressing Ctrl+T if CE2 is also enabled [#8900](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8900)
    - Image Editor: Added the current/total frame numbers to the status bar text [#5474](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5474)
    - Image Editor: Grid controls no longer allow clickthrough and affecting things underneath [#8866](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8866)

    - Licensing: GM no longer crashes when Legacy dialog attempts to sign-in using a blank password field [#9090](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9090)
    - Local Package Integration: Can now create working packages again [#9305](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9305)
    - Package Manager: No longer forgets the JavaScript package is installed each time the IDE is restarted [#8448](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8448)
    - Project Import: GM no longer crashes when extracting a .zip with non-ascii characters in the filename [#9578](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9578)
    - Project Load: Fixed an issue with importing projects could cause GM to lock up, revealed when importing some .yyzs made with 2024.1300 Betas into 2024.11 (note that the fix here is to prevent the situation happening in 2024.13 and future versions - 2024.11 will not be fixed) [#9321](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9321)
    - Project Load: If one project fails and then a second one loads correctly, the menu/tool bars disable lots of items [#8340](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8340)
    - Project Save: Deleting an Object used as a "following" in a viewport no longer corrupts the project, making it give compile and load errors [#8652](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8652)
    - ProjectTool: Exports now take the current IDE's resource versioning into consideration and so can no longer generate an export which is too new for that IDE to load in again [#9444](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9444)
    - Redefine Keys: [Mac IDE] Mapping "Start/End of Document" to Command-Up/Down keys now works [#9112](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9112)
    - Room Editor: Asset/Background layers correctly show their content if using a custom skin and there is a Path layer in that room [#8783](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8783)
    - Room Editor: Fix to "Don’t show it next time" Preference when deleting a room layer [#9049](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9049)
    - Room Editor: GM no longer goes unstable when copy/pasting or duplicating instances and then pressing Ctrl-Z to undo the changes [#1973](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/1973)
    - Sound Editor: GameMaker doesn't play an audio file from Audacity [#880](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/880)
    - Source Control: Fixed creating and committing to projects using the word “commit” in the comment [#9339](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9339) 
    - Sprite Editor: ToggleCollisionTypeOptions() errors can cause the editor window to fail to open [#8953](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8953)

    - Tile Set Editor: GM no longer crashes when using an external editor to enlarge a sprite used by a tileset [#9052](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9052)
    - UI/UX: [Mac IDE] Option+Right Arrow now positions the caret at the end of the current word, not at the start of the next word, so it's more consistent with macOS norms [#9099](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9099)

## Runtime Features And Changes

{% include important.html content="GMRT Users: Please be aware 2024.13 is incompatible with GMRT 0.15.0 and older - you will need to install newer 0.16.0+ packages in Package Manager before any projects will build using GMRT" %}

- **Android - Change To Minimum Game Options Values During Builds**
    - {% include important.html content="The 'Compile SDK' minimum value is now 34 - anything lower than this will cause your build to fail with a suitable message why" %}
    - Please do check this is correct when opening/building existing projects created in older IDEs!

- **Android - Support For Controlling Gradle Versions And New Graphics Settings**
    - The Gradle Version and Gradle Plugin Version required during a build are now editable by you and can be set per-project - there are new text fields in Game Options-> Android-> General for this
    - You can now enable Edge-to-Edge display and also allow control of the display layout via new settings in Game Options-> Android-> Graphics
    - For more (including a sample project showing this functionality), see [#8186](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8186)

- **Building Projects: Add support for calling batch files during a Clean operation**
    - You can now create your own batch and shell scripts for pre_clean_step.bat (or pre_clean_step.sh) AND post_clean_step.bat (or post_clean_step.sh)
    - These pre-post scripts can also be added to your extensions to add similar functionality there
    - For more, see [#8695](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8695)

- **Optimised Calling Of Functions (Introduces Changes To Inheritence!)**
    - The compiler will now optimise function calls when the script can be resolved directly
    - {% include important.html content="This does require a change in how you need to code your functions which use inheritance and then later get overridden inside child objects (e.g, functionA calls functionB, and in your child object you override functionB before calling functionA)" %}
    - You now need to either:
        - add "self." before functionA calls functionB
        - change the functionA declaration to be a method (so, rather than `function functionA(){}` use `functionA = function() {}`)
    - This change is documented (with simple code examples) in the section "Overridden Script Functions" of [the manual page for Script Functions Vs. Methods](https://manual.gamemaker.io/monthly/en/#t=GameMaker_Language%2FGML_Overview%2FScript_Functions_vs_Methods.htm)
    - Original info on this change and a small project which shows the code changes required before-and-after for the "self." route above can be found in [#10202](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10202#issuecomment-2792377582)
    - Also be aware of this other optimisation change:
        - Building Projects: [YYC] Calls to any function that returns the current "self", "other" and "global" are now optimised out [#9163](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9163)

- **Changes To Noone Being Returned By Some Functions**
    - When reviewing the below bug report we found several other places where "noone" was being passed back as the number -4 rather than an instance handle
    - In-Game: `layer_instance_get_instance()` returns "-4" when the element is not an instance, should be an invalid instance handle ("ref instance -4") [#9374](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9374)
    - These have all been changed to return an instance reference of -4
    - This may affect any code you have in your projects where you are checking for `is_number()` or `is_handle()` rather then looking for "noone"
    - Note that most of the locations changed were to do with collision code - where noone is passed back when nothing is found

- **Strings for handles to an asset now use the name of the asset rather than the number**
    - This is a change primarily because the name is stable between versions, when the ID number is not; however, it is also now much easier to read the strings and know which asset is being referred-to
    - For more, see [#9053](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9053)

- **handle_parse() Changes/Fixes**
    - This function now allows passing in your asset/function names (and) as part of the string rather than typing numbers in [#9020](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9020)
    - It also now supports GameMaker's built-in function names [#9021](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9021)
    - For invalid handles, it also now returns either "undefined" or "ref -1", depending on how/why the handle is invalid [#8957](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8957) and [#9293](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9293)
 
- **Create Physics Shapes At Runtime**
    - `sprite_get_convex_hull()` can now be used to generate the points of a convex hull for the given sprite
    - You supply a sprite index (which can be an asset added through the Asset Browser or a sprite added at runtime) and a precision value, and the function returns an array of reals defining the points of the convex hull
    - For more information see [#9472](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9472)

- **Added Functions For Automating Debug Inputs**
    - Added `debug_input_record()`, `debug_input_save()`, and `debug_input_playback()` functions to allow for developer test-automation
    - Note that these are only intended for use when testing your own games - not as part of released games
    - For more, see [#8409](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8409)

- **Using keywords as variables**
    - It is now possible to use keywords (e.g., "then", "do") as variable names
    - Please note that both Feather and the Code Editors will still mark those as errors, but the project will build and run with no problems

- **[GX.games] Added Tilt Support**
    - Device gyro functionality is now supported on Android and iOS mobile devices
    - Be aware this is a permission you must request from the player, and so the previously Android-only `os_request_permission()` has now been extended to work on more platforms
    - For more (including a sample project showing this functionality), see [#9267](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9267)

- **[GX.games] Added Camera Support**
    - You can now capture the feed from a camera and open it with `video_open()` in your games
    - Same as the change above, be aware this is a permission you must request from the player
    - For more (including a sample project showing this functionality), see [#9229](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9229)

- **Android & iOS - New Async Event When Layout Changes**
    - A new Async System message is sent when the display layout changes
    - This event is of type "DisplayLayoutInfo" and contains "safeinsettop", "safeinsetbottom", "safeinsetleft" and "safeinsetright" - which return the distance from that edge that it is safe to display in (i.e. where no system UI will cover it)
    - On Android only, the event also returns a "boundrects" entry that contains information on rectangles within those areas that are non-functional (Display Cutout)
    - If the display layout has a waterfall display, then this is also returned as "waterfallinsetbottom"/"waterfallinsettop"/"waterfallinsetleft"/"waterfallinsetright"
    - For more (including a sample project showing this functionality), see the same [#8186](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8186) mentioned in the section above

- **tvOS - Better Support For Siri Remotes**
    - You can now use newer remote versions and also get their gyro inputs - see the following two issues for a little more info:
    - Support for Siri Remote 2+ [#4254](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4254)
    - Support for the motion controls in the Siri Remote [#3959](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3959)

- **physics_debug() Added** 
    - Enables\disables physics errors which were previously being silently ignored
    - For more (including a sample project showing this functionality), see [#8997](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8997)

- **buffer_get_used_size() Added** 
    - Returns the actual usage size of the specified buffer, so you can see how much space is left in your buffer, etc.
    - For more, see [#9298](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9298)

- **"GM_runtime_type" added**
    - Added a new constant for determining if a game was built with the GMS2 runtimes or GMRT
    - For more, see [#9055](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9055)

- **gml_pragma() Support For Always Compiling Assets With Your Specified Tags**
    - Added a new "MarkTagAsUsed" command to say certain tags already added to your assets in the IDE denote that these assets must always be built, even when the Game Option for removing unused assets is ON
    - As an example, if I have an IDE tag called "AlwaysCompileMe" and I have assigned that to some assets, I could type : `gml_pragma("MarkTagAsUsed", "AlwaysCompileMe");`
    - For more, see [#8313](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8313)

- **Add Sprites via URL**
    - You can now use data URLs in `sprite_add()` and `sprite_replace()` to add and replace your sprites in game 
    - For more, see [#9344](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9344)

- **"Remove Unused Assets" Fixes For When Building Projects**
    - Lots of fixes for incorrect checks when something is still required, plus a number of ways in which debug runs (specifically) would give a silent crash or close rather than showing you a suitable code error first. 
    - See the changelist for all the details, as there are too many reports fixed already to list individually here

## Package And Prefab Features And Changes

{% include note.html content="We have released a selection of UI prefab Assets that you can use in your projects. You can access these by installing the appropriate collection inside Package Manager, then dragging them out of the Prefab Library and into your rooms/sequences." %}

- **Prefab Assets - "UI Button With Code" Example Now Available**
    - You are now able to download a simple example of a button prefab which has code associated to it and allows controls for configuring the button's appearance and behaviours
    - Find this "User Interface" prefab in Package Manager and add it to your Prefab Library, then you can give it a go by dragging it into your projects
    - This is a simple asset which shows how prefabs containing code can be added to a project and configured to the needs of that game
    - Future prefabs will expand on this to show more complex functionality
    - If you have any problems where you're unable to drag this prefab into your rooms, please ensure you have also installed the "UI Panels - Glossy" prefab that was released recently

- **ProjectTool Updated**
    - A newer "2024.13." version of ProjectTool was already released ahead of this GameMaker release - this IDE automatically uses that version; however, if you have previously installed ProjectTool versions manually, then you may need to modify Package Manager in order to use this newer version
    - If you see any issues with importing/exporting projects or packages, check to see if you have already got a version of ProjectTool installed inside Package Manager (in the "GM Tools" list)
    - If Package Manager currently says you're using any older "0." version, then be aware it's always the one in Package Manager that will be prefered by the IDE
    - Simply uninstall that old version and this will hopefully immediately resolve the problem you're seeing - if it does not, restart GameMaker and it will get the new one for you, and that should sort things

- **Windows IDE Updater Is Now A Package**
    - Rather than shipping a fixed version of the IDE updater inside the GM installer, GameMaker will now silently download the latest version of the updater when first starting GM after installing it (just like how it gets your runtimes at the moment)
    - While there is no need to routinely do this in order to get new GM versions in future, be aware the version you have installed _can_ also now be changed inside Package Manager - so, if it is ever required to update the Updater in order to see newer versions of GameMaker are available, you can immediately install the newest updater at that time and then restart GM to check for the IDE/runtime update you need
