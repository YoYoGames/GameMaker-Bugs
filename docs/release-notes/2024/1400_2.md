## Beta 3 - IDE 941/Runtime 926 Changes (Dec 10, 2025)

A very small release to get quick feedback on whether the Vsync change mentioned below makes things more reliable on your Windows PCs. The only changes since Beta 2 are the two listed below, so there's no link to a changelist in the heading this time.

### IDE Bugs Fixed

- Code Editor 1: Renaming a Note asset will make it not able to save any changes thereafter [#13189](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13189)

<br>

### In-Game Bugs Fixed

- In-Game: [Windows] Vsync changes are not applied immediately, instead they require toggling fullscreen or moving the game to a different monitor before the change is effective [#13184](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13184)
- Note that in order to prevent tearing you still need to enable vsync - this change merely makes toggling vsync on/off more reliable.

## Beta 2 - [IDE 940/Runtime 925 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14.2%20closed%3A2025-11-27..2025-12-02)  (Dec 03, 2025)

### Features Added Or Changed

- **Bug Reporter: IDE Crashes Now Offer To Include Your Last-Opened Project [#13079](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13079)**
    - As of this release, GameMaker will remember the last project you opened in an IDE session, so if a crash does happen, when GameMaker is next started you will be asked if you want to include that project
    - If you say yes, the project folder is zipped up and **privately** included with the bug report
    - Sometimes, a crash can be caused by something inside the project, and so sending it when requested avoids us having to ask for the project later on and there being a delay before we can begin investigating
 
- **Inspector: [Objects] Can Now Give Friendly Names For Your Variable Definitions [#13141](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13141)**
    - You can now use the Inspector to set a friendly name for each variable in your Objects' Variable Definitions window, which can be a useful helper for yourself
    - However, the real benefit is that these friendly names will now appear when that Object is used in a prefab and _someone else_ imports that prefab into their project, as now they can get your helper text also - which can really help them identify much more quickly/easily what each variable is used for

- **Room Editor: Shows The Current Grid Location's X/Y values On The Status Bar [#2851](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2851)**
    - In addition to the mouse position that's always been shown, the Room Editor now displays the grid location for wherever your mouse cursor currently is

<br>

### Crash/Stability Fixes

- Code Editor 2: GM no longer crashes when editing a Mouse Left Release event and autocomplete tried to appear [#11975](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11975)
- Object Editor: GM no longer crashes when deleting stuff in my project [#13070](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13070)
- Prefab Library: Fixed GM going unstable when Duplicating a Prefab into a project that contains an asset with the same name [#12893](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12893)
- Startup: [Ubuntu IDE] GM 2024.1400.2 no longer fails to load a plugin and enters an endless "restart to open bug reporter" loop [#13055](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13055)

<br>

### IDE Bugs Fixed

- Building Projects: Fixed that "finished." lines appear in Output window at the beginning of running a game for each filter/effect prefab used by that project [#12941](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12941)
- Building Projects: Fixed that Windy Woods in 2024.14.1 is generating a missing prefab compiler error and a popup that is missing strings [#13052](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13052)

- Code Editor 2: Resolved GML extension files did not save their edits [#12972](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12972)
- Code Editor 2: Using "change event" no longer makes all unsaved changes to that event unable to be saved [#12423](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12423)
- Game Options: [Main] Fixed that General > Deprecated Behaviours section's "more info" link opened the manual page for macOS Game Options [#12808](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12808)

- Project Save: Fixed after duplicating certain prefab assets, project can no longer be closed [#13047](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13047)
- Project Save: Fixed a way that duplicating a UI prefab in 2024.14.1 could break the project and make unable to save or be opened thereafter [#12919](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12919)
- ProjectTool: Fixed a situation where it wouldn't open if manually clicking on its menubar entry if it believed no project was open [#13014](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13014)

<br>

### Build Bugs Fixed

- Building Projects: Fixed that installing missing filter/effect prefabs in 2024.14.1 could still show an incorrect error about that prefab being missing (simply restarting the build fixed the issue thereafter) [#12796](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12796)

<br>

### In-Game Bugs Fixed

- In-Game: Fixed that "Animation Event" for my player Object in the attached project is no longer run in 2024.14.1 RTs, differs from other Objects with this event [#12999](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12999)

<hr>
<br>

## Beta 1 - [IDE 936/Runtime 921 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14.2%20closed%3A<2025-11-28)  (Nov 28, 2025)

### Features Added Or Changed

- **Bug Reporter: No Longer Deletes Crash Dumps You Said Yes To Sending Until The Upload Has Been Successful [#12850](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12850)**
    - Previously, if you said yes to sending us a crash dump, but then the upload failed for any reason you would lose the crash files because GameMaker deleted the loose originals prior to uploading the bug package and then removes the package as soon as the upload has finished (successfully or not)
    - Now, GameMaker will detect that there was an issue uploading the package and ask you if you want to try again
    - If you say to do this retry later, the dump and all files will be kept around until you next attempt the report submission

- **[macOS, iOS, tvOS] Added Support For C++/ObjC++ And Swift Interop Into The Xcode project [#12719](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12719)**
    - Extensions which require this interop between multiple languages are now better supported

- **Prefabs: Bundle-In All IDE Filters/Effects and SDF Support [#12870](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12870)**
    - As shown in the issue above (and the other one it mentions), the Room Editor in 2024.14.1 stopped showing all possible filters/effects and instead only showed the ones you had installed inside Package Manager
    - Now, all of these filter/effect prefabs, the one for SDF support and the one for the Particle System library, all come bundled as part of the installation process and so the list has accordingly gone back to showing all possible options again
    - As of this release, you will always have the version of the prefab which was the current one when your IDE version was made, but you can use Package Manager to update to newer versions if they are released

- **Prefabs: Ability To Add Customised Prefabs And New Quick Access Section**
    - You can now choose to Customise a prefab in your library, which will maintain the link to the base prefab, but now add a new entry into your Asset Browser, where you can then edit some of the inspectable elements - without modifying the base/original prefab 
    - All of your customised prefabs can be found in a new section in the Quick Access panel of the Asset Browser
    - You will also see that as of this release all prefabs (linked and customised) are shown in an orange colour to distinguish when their source comes from something external to your project
    - (If you "Duplicate" a prefab into your project, then it's part of your project and no longer a prefab, so these will not show any of the above changes) 

- **`room_get_info()` Extended To Give Live Info For The Current Room [#12685](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12685)**
    - This function has always given you a struct of all the level information for _other_ rooms, but prior to 2024.14 it didn't give you info on the current active room or its changes
    - The function has now been extended to take optional params to control whether you want to include the live state of the current room
    - Note: There was a partial implementation of this change already in earlier 2024.14 releases, but the early bugs have since been resolved and the feature extended fully

### Crash/Stability Fixes

- AnimCurve Editor: Fixed that GM went unstable after copying/pasting curve values between tracks in a shared animcurve [#12720](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12720)
- Object Editor: Fixed the Physics Collision Shape panel to show the sprite again and that changing mask type was causing GM to go unstable [#12846](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12846)
- Sprite Editor: GM no longer crashes when using Ctrl+C to copy a frame in 2024.14.1 [#12923](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12923)
- Stability: [Mac IDE] GM no longer crashes during routine usage, likely due to network adapter hiccup [#11590](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11590)

<br>

### IDE Bugs Fixed

- Feather: Fixed that prefab Object Methods were not coloured [#11899](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11899)
- Filters and Effects: Fixed that the effect type list was completely blank when a project is first opened, causing IDE lag and repeated project saves [#12868](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12868)
- Image Editor: Fixed that renaming a Sprite while editing made all further edits not display any change until the image was reopened [#12922](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12922)
- In-Game: Resolved audio group load messages in Output window were marked as warnings in 2024.14.1 [#12768](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12768)
- Inspector: [Mac IDE] Fixed the "Inspector: ..." label was missing padding at top and bottom [#12474](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12474)
- Object Editor: Variable Definitions dialog no longer allows the "-" character to be typed in the name field, as this will cause compile fails (any project already in this state will need you to fix its variable names) [#12896](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12896)
- Prefabs: Fixed that fonts which have "regenerateBitmap=true" in its .yy file sometimes generated an override font texture even when the font is not used or been modified [#12013](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12013)
- Prefabs: Fixed that there was no way to uninstall a prefab if its version is no longer available for install in Package Manager [#12826](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12826)
- Preferences: Fixed that "Modify Current Runtime Modules" settings were not loaded correctly in 2024.14.1 if you start GM as a guest user and then sign-in sometime after startup [#12872](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12872)

- Project Layout: Fixed that customisations made when logged-in are lost if you later open that project while logged-out (and vice-versa) [#11811](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/11811)
- Project Save: "Add Existing" and picking assets which reuse an existing asset's name but with title-case changes did not import correctly [#12779](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12779)
- Project Save: You can now remove links for filters/effects after addeding them, so you're able to build the project again after uninstalling that prefab [#12895](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12895)

- Workspaces: Resolved after creating or loading a project the workspace and general IDE images not load promptly [#12597](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12597)

<br>

### Build Bugs Fixed
