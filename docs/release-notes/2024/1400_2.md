## Beta 1 - [IDE 936/Runtime 921 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20milestone%3A2024.14.2%20closed%3A<2025-11-28)  (Nov 28, 2025)

### Features Added Or Changed

- **Bug Reporter: No Longer Deletes Crash Dumps You Said Yes To Sending Until The Upload Has Been Successful [#12850](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12850)**
    - Previously, if you said yes to sending us a crash dump, but then the upload failed for any reason you would lose the crash files because GameMaker deleted the loose originals prior to uploading the bug package and then removes the package as soon as the upload has finished (successfully or not)
    - Now, GameMaker will detect that there was an issue uploading the package and ask you if you want to try again
    - If you say to do this retry later, the dump and all files will be kept around until you next attempt the report submission

- **[macOS, iOS, tvOS] Added Support For C++/ObjC++ And Swift Interop Into The Xcode project [#12719](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12719)**
    - Extensions which require this interop between multiple languages are now better supported

- **Prefabs: Bundle-In All IDE Filters/Effects and SDF Support [#12870](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12870)**
    - As shown in the issue above (and the other one it mentions), the Room Editor in 2024.14.1 stopped showing all possible filters/effects and instead only showed the ones you had installed inside Package Manager
    - Now, all of these filter/effect prefabs, the one for SDF support and the one for the Particle System library, all come bundled as part of the installation process and so the list has accordingly gone back to showing all possible options again
    - As of this release, you will always have the version of the prefab which was the current one when your IDE version was made, but you can use Package Manager to update to newer versions if they are released

- **Prefabs: Ability To Add Customised Prefabs And New Quick Access Section**
    - You can now choose to Customise a prefab in your library, which will maintain the link to the base prefab, but now add a new entry into your Asset Browser, where you can then edit some of the inspectable elements - without modifying the base/original prefab 
    - All of your customised prefabs can be found in a new section in the Quick Access panel of the Asset Browser
    - You will also see that as of this release all prefabs (linked and customised) are shown in an orange colour to distinguish when their source comes from something external to your project
    - (If you "Duplicate" a prefab into your project, then it's part of your project and no longer a prefab, so these will not show any of the above changes) 

- **`room_get_info()` Extended To Give Live Info For The Current Room [#12685](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12685)**
    - This function has always given you a struct of all the level information for _other_ rooms, but prior to 2024.14 it didn't give you info on the current active room or its changes
    - The function has now been extended to take optional params to control whether you want to include the live state of the current room
    - Note: There was a partial implementation of this change already in earlier 2024.14 releases, but the early bugs have since been resolved and the feature extended fully

- Prefabs: Fixed that fonts which have "regenerateBitmap=true" in its .yy file sometimes generated an override font texture even when the font is not used or been modified [#12013](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12013)
