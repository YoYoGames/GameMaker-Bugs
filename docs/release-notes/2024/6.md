## IDE Featured Changes

- **Updated to .NET Framework 8**
    - The IDEs all now use .NET Framework 8, rather than 6, which should give more stability and better future-proofing as Windows and macOS (and Ubuntu) make changes in their operating systems
    - {% include note.html content="Mac IDE users who have been using GameMaker for a long time may find that their settings files have moved on disk (although you should see any differences inside GameMaker) and will now be using the newer location macOS/.NET 6 has used for a while if you were to have installed GameMaker from fresh" %}
 
- **Larger Instances Panel in the Room Editor**
    - Room Editor has had a change to move the instances list out of the side dock to become its own new snappable panel, which appears when an appropriate layer is selected
 
- **Text In Rooms Support**
    - Added the ability to place static text within a room, similar to how text within Sequences works
    - You can then manipulate the text at runtime using the various functions listed lower down this page (and documented in the manual also)

- **Sequence Editor Additions**
    - Exposed separate emitter "reference distance", "maximum distance", and "falloff factor" parameters for audio tracks, rather than the one "falloff" parameter available in previous GM releases [#4578](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4578)
    - Text track "Alignment" settings can now be changed when the "Wrapping" setting is disabled [#5903](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5903)
    - Pitch changes via audio track parameters now get applied when previewing that audio in the IDE, so you don't have to build the game to hear the parameter working [#1328](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/1328)
    - Creating a new key now automatically selects that new key also [#5655](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5655)

- **Bug Reporter Additions**
    - Crash reports now also include some recent “.gz” ui.log archives in with bug reports and then cleans all of these archive files out from GM's settings folder [#5935](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5935)
    - Added a link for how/where to report security issues [#5567](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5567)

- **Misc UI/UX Changes**
    - Asset Browser/Inspector: Assets now only open in the Inspector after the click is released, rather than when pressed [#5490](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5490)
    - [Mac IDE] OS-standard text navigation hotkeys for selecting words/lines are now respected throughout the IDE and in CE1 [#5427](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5427)
    - Typing non-Latin/diacritics characters into a multiline textbox no longer triggers any Redefine Keys entries which have that same combination [#5916](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5916)
    - _Many_ more fixes to Hot Keys to make them work correctly on different OSes and keyboard layouts, plus additional/fixed entries in Redefine Keys so you can customise even more commands
 
- **Misc Install/Startup Changes**
    - Sound Editor: [Mac IDE] GM no longer asks for Rosetta to be installed/no longer crashes on M-series Macs when creating/opening sounds if Rosetta is not installed [#2592](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2592)
    - Startup: "Processing User" stage should now be faster, so starting additional IDE instances is also faster [#5671](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5671)

- **Misc Editor Fixes**
    - Code Editor: Reusing method names in multiple objects and pressing F1 now more reliably navigates to the correct object for _that_ selected line of code [#4322](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4322)
    - Code Editor (Visual): `If Object At Place`, `If Collision Shape`, and `If Collision Point` no longer cause in-game memory leaks if their "Free Target" option is checked (_note that if you already have a project containing any of these 3 nodes, you will need to delete and re-add them manually yourself one time in order to pick up the fix_) [#6069](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6069)
    - Object Editor: Changing a Variable Definition from Bool to Expression no longer makes your "true"/"false" value incorrectly use title case (_note that if you already have a project containing this issue, you will need to fix it manually yourself one time_) [#4898](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4898)

- **Misc Performance/Stabilty Improvements**
    - Asset Browser: Renaming an asset now immediately sets the project as edited, so the changes are picked up when building the game [#6109](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6109)
    - Code Editor (Visual): Fixed a delay when using the Edit menu's Undo/Redo commands compared to using the equivalent hotkeys (Ctrl+Z/Y) [#6436](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6436)
    - Performance: [Mac IDE] Initial threading fixes to _reduce_ "stutters" and rapidly-increasing RAM usage during extended sessions of editing projects (_there is more to come here, so the isseue is still open at this time_) [#4424](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4898)
    - Performance: [Mac IDE] ProMotion displays now obey the Max FPS value set in Preferences, which reduces battery usage and improves performance [#5722](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5722)
    - Project Import: No longer possible to import/convert an old project and Game Options will set the game speed to 0 FPS, causing games to run unpredicatably fast - now it will revert the value to the 60 default [#5849](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5849)
    - Project Saving: Deleting an event you have just cut all the contents from no longer causes a File Watcher dialog, which avoids a situation where you could reload the project and accidentally remove that code from the event you had pasted it into [#6252](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6252)
    - Project Save: Source Control Conflicts window will no longer be shown for projects where source control is not enabled inside GameMaker, but which do use external git [#6025](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6025)
    - Project Tool: Added a list of supported project export formats and also signing support for packages
    - Stability: GM no longer crashes when waking a PC from from sleep and the only OS audio output was a Bluetooth device which no longer exists [#2633](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2633)

## Runtime Featured Changes

- **Physics Raycasting**
    - Added a new function `physics_raycast(xStart,yStart,xEnd,yEnd,ids,[all_hits],[max_fraction],...)`, which checks the physics fixtures of the objects given against the ray specified
    - This returns an array of structures that give the "hitPointX/Y" (the room coordinates of the intersection), "normalX/Y" (the normal of the intersection), and "fraction" (the normalised distance down the ray of the intersection)

- **Access to a Surface's Depth and Stencil Buffers**
    - Added new functions that allow you to gain access to the internal depth buffer texture of surfaces, so that it can be referenced in your own deferred shaders [#3708](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/3708)
    - This allows you to use the already-existing depth information to be used by shaders you can now create for achieving many popular shader effects - e.g., screen-space ambient occlusion (SSAO), screen-space reflections (SSR), depth of field (DOF), and shadow-mapping.

- **Misc Fixes For Building Your Projects**
    - {% include important.html content="PS4 SDK version increased - see the Required SDKs FAQ before trying to do any builds" %}

- **Input/Output Methods Changes/Fixes**
    - Added support for desktop platforms to block the use of an IME during gameplay [#5524](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5524)
    - DualShock 4/DualSense pads no longer have "gp_select" and "gp_home" switched and "gp_touchbutton" now works again [#5754](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5754)
    - [macOS and Ubuntu] vk_... codes are no longer always QWERTY and so now match if a different physical keyboard layout is used [#5525](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5525)
    - [Windows] window_enable_borderless_fullscreen(true) now gives the correct results if called when the game is on a secondary monitor [#5164](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5164)
  
- **Audio Support Changes/Fixes**
    - Added support for setting an individual audio instance's gain higher than 1 [#5580](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5580)
    - Added `audio_sound_get_asset()` for returning the Sound asset played by that sound instance ID [#5861](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5861)
    - Three new separate emitter "reference distance", "maximum distance", and "falloff factor" parameters for Sequences audio tracks are carried through to in-game (when the old "falloff" parameter was not) [#4578](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4578)
    - [iOS] Added support for changing audio session, so that audio still plays when the phone is set to silent mode [#5146](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/5146)

## Misc New Functions

- `layer_text_get_id(layer_id,text_element_name)` - This function can be used to retrieve the unique ID value of a text element on a layer. You supply the layer ID (which you get when you create the layer using layer_create() or when you use the layer name along with layer_get_id()) and the name of the text element as defined in the Room Editor. The function will return the ID value associated with that text element on the layer.
- `layer_text_exists(layer_id,text_element_id)` - You can use this function to check and see if a text element exists on any given layer. You supply the layer ID (which you get when you create the layer using layer_create()) or the layer name (as a string - this will have a performance impact) and the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()) and the function will return either true if the element exists, or false if it does not.
- `layer_text_create(layer_id,x,y,font,text)` - With this function you can create a new text element on the specified layer. You supply the layer ID (which you get when you create the layer using layer_create() or when you use the layer name along with layer_get_id()), a position within the room, a font reference (which would be the name of the font as shown in the Asset Browser), and the text to be displayed and it will be added to the layer. The function returns the unique ID value for the element, which can then be used in further layer functions for text elements.
- `layer_text_destroy(text_element_id)` - This function will destroy the given text element. You supply the text ID (which you get when you create the text using layer_text_create() or when you use the layer ID along with layer_get_text_id()) and this will remove it. Note that this does not remove the layer, only the text element from it, and if the text element is one that has been added in the room editor, then the next time you leave the room and then return, the text element will be recreated again. However if the room is persistent, the text element will be removed unless room persistence is switched off again.
- `layer_text_x(text_element_id,x)` - This function controls the position along the x-axis of the room of the text element on the layer. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then set the x value to use (based on the room coordinates).
- `layer_text_y(text_element_id,y)` - This function controls the position along the y-axis of the room of the text element on the layer. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then set the y value to use (based on the room coordinates).
- `layer_text_angle(text_element_id,angle)` - Using this function you can change the angle for the given text element on a layer. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then set the angle value, from 0 to 359 anti-clockwise, where 0 is to the right, 90 is to the top, 180 is to the left and 270 is to the bottom. If you set a value greater than 360 this will be looped to bring it within the 0 - 359 range.
- `layer_text_xscale(text_element_id,xscale)` - Using this function you can change whether the given text element on a layer should be scaled along the x axis or not. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then set the scale value. A scale of 1 indicates no scaling (1:1), smaller values will scale down (0.5, for example, will half the width of the text element), larger values will scale up, and negative values will flip the text element and scale it unless the value used is exactly -1 (in which case the text element used is just flipped right-to-left about its origin position with no scaling).
- `layer_text_yscale(text_element_id,yscale)` - Using this function you can change whether the given text element on a layer should be scaled along the y axis or not. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then set the scale value. A scale of 1 indicates no scaling (1:1), smaller values will scale down (0.5, for example, will half the height of the text element), larger values will scale up, and negative values will flip the text element and scale it unless the value used is exactly -1 (in which case the text element used is just mirrored top-to-bottom about its origin position with no scaling).
- `layer_text_blend(text_element_id,blend)` - This function controls the colour (or "tinting") of the text element and the default value is -1 (which represents the constant c_white, which can also be used). Any other value (including internal colour constants like c_red, or c_aqua) will draw the text element with the specified colour. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then set the colour to use.
- `layer_text_alpha(text_element_id,alpha)` - This function controls the alpha (transparency) of the text element on the asset layer. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then set the alpha value to use. Alpha can be between 0 (fully transparent) and 1 (fully opaque) with the default alpha value for the text element being 1. Note that if the layer the text element has been assigned to is not visible - or the element itself has been made invisible - you will not see any difference with this function until the layer or element has been made visible again.
- `layer_text_font(text_element_id,font)` - Using this function you can change the font resource assigned to a given text element on a layer. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then supply a font resource reference which the text element will be changed to use.
- `layer_text_xorigin(text_element_id,xorigin)` - Using this function you can change the x position of the origin of the given text element. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then set the origin value.
- `layer_text_yorigin(text_element_id,yorigin)` - Using this function you can change the y position of the origin of the given text element. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then set the origin value.
- `layer_text_text(text_element_id,text)` - Using this function you can change the text string assigned to a given text element on a layer. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then supply a text string which the text element will be changed to use.
- `layer_text_halign(text_element_id,alignment)` - Using this function you can change the horizontal alignment of the given text element. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then set the alignment value.
- `layer_text_valign(text_element_id,alignment)` - Using this function you can change the vertical alignment of the given text element. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then set the alignment value.
- `layer_text_charspacing(text_element_id,charspacing)` - Using this function you can change the character spacing of the given text element. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then set the spacing value.

This only affects rendering when wrapping is enabled.
- `layer_text_frameh(text_element_id,height)` - Using this function you can change the height of the frame of the given text element. You give the text element ID (which you get when you create a text element using layer_text_create() or when you use the function layer_text_get_id()), and then set the frame width value. The affects vertical alignment of the text.

- `buffer_get_surface_depth(buffer,surface,offset)` - With this function you can write information from a surface's depth buffer to a given buffer. The buffer must have been created previously and should be a 1-byte aligned buffer large enough to store data for the surface you are going to write (if unsure, use a grow buffer or see the example at the bottom of this page).
- `buffer_set_surface_depth(buffer,surface,offset)` - With this function you can write information from a buffer to a depth buffer of a given surface. Both the buffer being read from and the surface being written to must have been created previously, and you can provide an offset into the buffer to start reading from. Note that reading will always start at the beginning of the buffer plus the offset value and not at the current seek position plus the offset value.
- `dbg_text_separator(dbgref)` - Creates a text separator entry (from a variable) within the current debug section, this text can be multiline and is not split into 2 columns but shown in a single column. NOTE: if no section is declared a "Default" section will be created.
- `draw_clear_depth(depth)` - This function can be used to clear the depth buffer of the current render target.
- `draw_clear_ext([col],[alpha],[depth],[stencil])` - This function can be used to clear colour, depth and stencil of the current render target.
- `draw_clear_stencil(stencil)` - This function can be used to clear the stencil buffer of the current render target.
- `gpu_get_sprite_cull()` - With this function you can check to see whether sprite culling is enabled (returns true) or not (returns false). For more information on sprite culling, see the function gpu_set_sprite_culling().
- `gpu_get_stencil_depth_fail()` - This function can be used to retrieve the stencil operation executed when the stencil test passes but the depth test fails.
- `gpu_get_stencil_enable()` - This function can be used to retreive whether the stencil test is currently enabled (returns true) or not (returns false).
- `gpu_get_stencil_fail()` - This function can be used to retrieve the stencil operation executed when the stencil test fails.
- `gpu_get_stencil_func()` - This function can be used to retrieve the current stencil test function.
- `gpu_get_stencil_pass()` - This function can be used to retrieve the stencil operation executed when both stencil and depth test pass.
- `gpu_get_stencil_read_mask()` - This function can be used to retrieve the current stencil test read mask value.
- `gpu_get_stencil_ref()` - This function can be used to retrieve the current stencil test reference value.
- `gpu_get_stencil_write_mask()` - This function can be used to retrieve the current stencil test write mask value.
- `gpu_set_sprite_cull(enable)` - This function will enable or disable sprite culling for your game (by default this is enabled). By switching sprite culling off you can avoid any problems with for example sprites not being drawn when using custom shaders that alter the position the sprite is drawn at
- `gpu_set_stencil_depth_fail(stencil_op)` - This function can be used to set the stencil operation taken when the stencil test passes but the depth test fails.
- `gpu_set_stencil_enable(enable)` - This function can be used to disable or enable the stencil test.
- `gpu_set_stencil_fail(stencil_op)` - This function can be used to set the stencil operation taken when the stencil test fails.
- `gpu_set_stencil_func(cmp_func)` - This function can be used to set the stencil test function.
- `gpu_set_stencil_pass(stencil_op)` - This function can be used to set the stencil operation taken when both the stencil and the depth test pass.
- `gpu_set_stencil_read_mask(read_mask)` - This function can be used to set the stencil test read mask.
- `gpu_set_stencil_ref(ref)` - This function can be used to set the stencil test reference value.
- `gpu_set_stencil_write_mask(write_mask)` - This function can be used to set the stencil test write mask.
- `surface_get_target_depth()` - This function can be used to retrieve the ID of the surface whose depth buffer is set as the current one.
- `surface_get_texture_depth(surface_id)` - This function returns a special pointer for the depth buffer texture of a surface. This value can then be used in other draw functions, particularly in general 3D and some of the 2D primitive functions.
- `surface_has_depth(surface_id)` - This function returns whether given surface has a depth buffer (returns true) or not (returns false). By default all surfaces have a depth buffer unless depth buffers are disabled using function surface_depth_disable().
- `physics_raycast(xStart,yStart,xEnd,yEnd,ids,[all_hits],max_fraction)` - This function checks the physics fixtures of the objects given against the ray specified, it will return an array of structures that will give the hitPointX, hitPointY (the room coordinates of the intersection), normalX, normalY (the normal of the intersection), fraction (the normalised distance down the ray of the intersection) 
- `struct_exists_from_hash(struct,hash)` - With this function you can check whether a variable exists within the given struct or not. . The function will return true if a variable with the given hash exists for the struct and false otherwise.
- `struct_remove_from_hash(struct,hash)` - With this function you can remove a variable from a struct. You supply the struct ID to remove the variable from and the hash of the variable to be removed.
