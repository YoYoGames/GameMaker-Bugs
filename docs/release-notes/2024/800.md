Download Links: [Windows](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Installer-2024.800.0.602.exe) - [macOS](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-2024.800.0.602.pkg) -  [Ubuntu Beta](https://gms.yoyogames.com/GameMaker-Beta-2024.800.0.602.deb)

<br>

## Beta 3 - [IDE 602/Runtime 624 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.8+closed%3A2024-07-25..2024-07-31)  (Aug 1, 2024)

- **"Contact-Us Package" Tool Upgraded To Upload Your Files Privately**
    - Help > _Create Your Contact Us Package_ has now been upgraded to become _Help > Upload a Bug/Ticket Sample_ [#6375](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6375)
    - This tool still grabs all your log files automatically and turns them into a .zip file, but now the new dialog allows you to add an example project and any additional files you want to include and then, crucially, it will now **privately** upload the .zip to our server for you
    - You are then returned a URL (there's a clickable button to copy this to your OS clipboard) and you can add that URL onto any GitHub bug report or customer service ticket, safe in the knowledge that only GameMaker staff can access that upload (you can't even download it yourself)
    - This means you can now very easily add missing samples onto bug reports whenever we request a project, or send logs and other information in support of _other user's_ bug reports to show you have the same problem, etc. - you no longer need to report a duplicate copy of any bug report just to privately send us additional files!
    - Note: If you're someone who prefers using the GitHub website forms for creating bug reports, rather than the IDE, then we would **strongly** recommend using this tool for all files you wish to link to on the bug report, rather than using any external fire-sharing host or attaching files publicly on the bug form

- **Bug Reporter Now Warns About Mismatched IDE/Runtime Versions**
    - Due partly to a huge number of historical users coming back to GameMaker with the recent 2024.6.2 release (which is fantastic) and also partly due to a runtimes-checking bug in that IDE version (which is not...), we have seen a lot of reports recently from users who are using wildly out-of-date runtimes because their GameMaker install is not updating automatically and they have not noticed the problem before they send a bug report
    - Accordingly, the bug reporter will now alert you when you're not using the correct runtime "family" that the current IDE you're using expects [#6866](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6866)
    - E.g., if you're _not_ using any "2024.8.whatever" runtime with the "2024.8.whatever" IDE, then the bug reporter will suggest that you update your GameMaker install or at least set the correct runtime as active and confirm if that stops the problem
    - This means you get the information on how and where to fix your GameMaker setup immediately and in most cases you then won't need to send a bug report
    - Note that it is valid to use different runtime versions to the IDE version, as you may want to stay on older runtimes in order to finish off a project before you update, and so the bug reporter will allow a _slightly_ newer/older runtime family to be used and still send a bug report
    - However, _very_ different runtimes (more than a couple of releases too old or too new) will block you from sending a bug report until you return to the correct versions
    - _A polite reminder to always read the release notes and then also search the bug database (or at the very least check the 3 pinned issues at the top of the page) before you send any reports!_
    - _And if you use **Steam** to run GameMaker, remember that there are additional important release notes on the Steam store page for your GameMaker install each time a new version is released._
    
- **IDE Featured Changes**
    - Debugger: RAM usage remains very high after viewing large surfaces, even after closing the debugger [#6821](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6821)
    - Debugger: If an instance bound is set to NaN when hitting a breakpoint this crashes the game before that break happens [#6818](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6818)
    - Package Manager: Menu item becomes disabled on closing a project and returning to the Start Page [#6898](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6898)
    - Startup: [Mac IDE] GM crash during first start after installing a new IDE because the runtime install path cannot be found [#6863](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6863)
    - And a _lot_ more Code Editor 2 fixes

- **Runtime Featured Changes**
    - Building Projects: In-game only Effects being used on a room layer gives error "it, or its linked prefab libraries, need upgrading" in 2024.800 Beta 2 [#6865](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6865)

## Beta 2 - [IDE 597/Runtime 620 Changes](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A2024.8+closed%3A2024-07-18..2024-07-24)  (Jul 25, 2024)

- **Stalls/Freezes Fix**
    - A memory/performance issue has been found and fixed, which should greatly help reduce or hopefully eliminate freezes/stutters some users saw when editing their projects and scrolling/panning windows or typing in the code editor
    - This was most commonly reported as something which built up over time, or suddenly started after using GM for a while, but this time element has since found to not be required and we could recreate the slow-down pretty soon after loading and working on a project by performing certain steps
    - For more information on the _types of actions_ or _areas of the IDE_ which saw these stutters on various users' machines, please see the long-running issue linked below - however, bear in mind that a lot of the information here is now out-of-date and was often speculative, so if you saw freezes but your experience doesn't exactly match what's written in that issue, be aware that you will _likely_ still see the same benefit from the change above
    - Performance: Short freezes/lag if GM kept open for a while after editing code [#2528](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/2528)
    - If you _do_ still see freezes in this release, please report a **new** bug and ensure you provide _detailed_ steps/information on what you were doing when the stutters occured and also allow the IDE bug reporter to attach your project (please don't reply to that old issue now)

- **GMRT Open Beta**
    - This version of GameMaker gives you an early look at the new Package Manager and GMRT export target (currently only for Windows and GX.games)
    - For more information on what these new features are and how to get started, see [the GMRT Open Beta blog post](https://gamemaker.io/en/blog/gmrt-open-beta)
    - It's worth saying just now that GMRT will remain only available in Beta releases for a long time yet

- **Toggling Code Editor Type Now Requires A Restart**
    - In order to stop a number of "temporary" issues caused by changing CE1 > CE2 or CE2 > CE1, GameMaker will now ask you to restart before it will apply the change fully
    - This means whatever code editor you had active will remain the active one, and your editor windows will not change straight away

- **IDE Featured Changes**
    - Bug Reporter: Improved the "PrivateIssueError" message to be something much more informative (the issue was always that your GameMaker account was not authorised on GitHub via the newer "Enterprise" button on your account panel) [#6836](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6836)
    - Redefine Keys: Added save/load functionality for saving out you user remaps to a file [#4838](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/4838)
    - Plus a number of Code Editor 2 fixes

- **Runtime Featured Changes**

    - In-Game: weak_ref_create() can now take an Id.Instance and create a weak_ref to it [#6778](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6778)
    - In-Game: [Desktops, GX.games] keyboard_virtual_height() when no virtual keyboard is enabled should return a consistent "0" to match iOS/Android, rather than "undefined" [#6549](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6549)
    - In-Game: Error "OpenAL error: 40963 (After playing sound)" no longer appears repeatedly after longer game sessions and causes some sounds stop playing [#6755](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6755) / In-Game: Playing streamed sounds from outside the sandbox generates errors that block other sounds from playing [#6727](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6727)
    - In-Game: Objects cannot use with() to reach the scope inside itself in 2024.800 Beta 1 [#6765](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6765)
    - In-Game: [YYC] "Input" library causes a silent crash in 2024.800 Beta 1, because "self" is being set to static outside constructors [#6759](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6759)
    - In-Game: [YYC] finally() can cause a silent crash when executed in specific scenarios [#6729](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6729)
    - In-Game: [HTML5] Issues running projects in 2024.800 Beta 1 when various target Preferences are enabled [#6748](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/6748)

The sprite is specified with the given reference, the width and height of the button specified in pixels (width and height of the sprite is used if not specified). Bits of the sprite can be displayed by specifying the x and y offset along with width and height (if none given then the whole sprite is used). NOTE: if no section is declared a "Default" section will be created.
- `gpu_set_scissor(xOrStruct,[y],[w],[h])` - This function can be used to set a scissor region that will clip all rendering to the current render target, all coordinates are in render target coordinate system. NOTE: All values are used as integers. NOTE: Each surface and viewport will reset the current scissor region (they are not stacked).
- `gpu_get_scissor()` - This function can be used to get the current scissor region, returns a struct that contains {x, y, w, h}.
