### Features Added Or Changed

- **Asset Browser: Updated drag-and-drop flow for Prefab creation [#13585](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13585)**
    - You can now drag prefabs from the Prefab Library directly to the Asset Browser in order to add them as custom prefabs
    - More info on how this works/what it means thereafter can be found on the issue (linked above)

- **Code Editor 2: "Rename Identifier" command now works also when caret is at the start of the identifier [#12381](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12381)**
    - Previously, this command only worked if the caret was on/immediately after the identifier name - now, it supports the caret being immediately before the name also

- **Code Snippets: "$" Characters Can Now Be Escaped And Therefore Used For Structs [#12827](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12827)**
    - "$" being used as the line break character meant that in previous GM releases you could not create struct-based snippets
    - You can now escape the character by using a backslash before it ("\$") and therefore use this escaped character when declaring structs
    - For your line break characters you obviously remain using "$" on its own (with no backslash)

- **Compile Errors: Ensure we open an instance's Object Variables when the error is in there [#13583](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13583)**
    - Following on from https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13202, if a compile error refers to a problem with Variable Definitions values, up until now GameMaker would incorrectly open that instance's creation code, when it should have open the Variable Definitions dialog for that Object/Instance
    - Now, it will open the correct place and therefore highlight the problem much more clearly 

- **Game Options: Newly-created projects should default Vsync to ON [#13197](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13197) and [#13551](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13551)**
    - Given the changes earlier in 2024.14, this is the most likely desired value for projects going forward
    - Accordingly, this default has now been changed for all targets

- **In-Game: Add ability to set individual array entries for Sequence properties [#12723](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12723)**
    - Previously, to set the value of Sequence properties which accept arrays, the entire array had to be set in a single operation - e.g. the `colour` variable has 4 elements, so `colour_track.keyframes[0].channels[0].colour = [1, 1, 1, 1]`
    - However, now you can set these individually if you wish - e.g. `colour_track.keyframes[0].channels[0].colour[0] = 1`
    - Note that there are a variety of Sequence values that now support this functionality, so do see the issue for an in-depth explanation and an example project

- **Manual Content: Uses the page's title for the browser tab titles, so that it's easier to see/remember what they are showing [#12774](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/12774)**
    - Previously, most pages in the manual used the same generic "GameMaker Manual" type title, so if you had multiple browser tabs showing different parts of the manual it was easy to forget which was the one you wanted, because they all looked identical
    - Now, the page's own title is used, so each tab will be much more identifiable

- **New Reddit target**
    - Reddit is now a target for Gamemaker
    - This uses the Devvit tools by Reddit and is a replacement to the Reddit extension that was previously provided by GameMaker
    - This target's setup guide can be found [here](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMakerRedditTemplate/blob/main/docs/HowToBuild.md)
    - Please be aware that this target works quite differently from all others inside GameMaker and requires you to initially setup your Reddit project and also to run the Devvit tools yourself outside GameMaker in order to actually get your changes built and sent to Reddit each time - accordingly, please see the setup guide above before you try using this target
    - More information about Devvit and getting started with Reddit publishing can be found [here](https://developers.reddit.com/docs/)

- **Package Manager: Added "Update all" Functionality For When Multiple Packages Have Updates**
    - Simultaneous notifications for Package Manager updates being available have been collated into a single notification and clicking this will take you to a new "Update All" window [#8625](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/8625)
    - And now you're able to click the one button to queue and update all of the packages [#10297](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/10297)

- **Prefab Library: Reinstall A Collection via right-click menu #13249 [#13249](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13249)**
    - Added support for reinstalling a Prefab Collection via the right-click menu when selecting the collection
    - In this way, you can "undo" customisations made to that collection's prefabs that you no longer want and instead go back to a fresh start

- **Prefabs: Able To Modify A Prefab's Macros [#9781](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/9781)**
    - Added support for modifying any exposed macros in a prefab

- **Prefabs: Included Files Support [#13703](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13703)**
    - As there are situations in which Included Files may be required when developing prefab collections, these files are now allowed to be added to prefab packages
    - Note that when duplicating Included Files from a prefab into your project they'll go directly into the datafiles folder of the project as per normal and therefore do not appear in the Asset Browser tree

- **Prefabs: Previewing Of Notes/Shaders/Scripts [#13702](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13702)**
    - Similar to how you can already preview code in events, you can now preview all of these types of assets without having to add their file(s) to your project.
    - If a Note is a markdown file GM will use the markdown viewer for the preview of that file, rather than showing you the raw text in an editor

- **Preferences can now be imported from other GameMaker installs**
    - There is now an option in Preferences that will let you select a different GameMaker install's local_settings.json file to import into this Beta
    - This means as we head towards LTS26 you can ensure that all of your GameMaker installs use the same Preferences values just now, and then be able to import them into that LTS version whenever it is released
    - Though you only select the local_settings.json file, be aware all preferences are brought over (including any redefined keys you may have set)
    - Information about the files involved and importing your Preferences can be found [here](https://manual.gamemaker.io/beta/en/#t=Setting_Up_And_Version_Information%252FIDE_Preferences.htm)

- **Variable Definitions: Ensure validation checks are setup per variable Type, so that invalid data cannot be entered [#13582](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13582)**
    - Following on from https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13202

- Prefab Library: Fixed that you were unable to clear filters for some prefab types once selected [#13177](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13177)

- Search & Replace: Resolved that the dialog not move correctly when dragged to a new location [#13146](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13146)

- Variable Definitions: Fixed that Real and Int type variables set to high numbers would get forcefully rounded down [#13550](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13550)
- Variable Definitions: Fixed that variables with the type "real" that were previously set to anything that wasn't a number literal would show up blank, and the value was lost when changing type [#13451](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13451)
- Variable Definitions: Labels are now shown in place of variable names, if set [#13137](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/13137)
