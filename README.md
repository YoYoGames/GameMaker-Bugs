# GameMaker Bugs & Feature Requests
 
Please do report bugs here for problems you have found inside GameMaker and its manual; however, before submitting anything, it is essential that you carefully read the rest of this page, so that you can be sure the issue is something you need to tell us about and is not reported already.

Here you can also suggest, request, and vote on new features for the GameMaker IDE and Runtime. We value user feedback and strive to make GameMaker the best it can be for developers, so by submitting your feature request you might help us make Gamemaker even better.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your problem is to do with signing-in or not seeing your correct platforms in Target Manager (even after signing-out and in again), our setup guides, then please continue to contact our customer services team in the usual manner.
> 
> If your issue is anything to do with console support, then the consoles have their own dedicated bug databases, so do not report things here - either use the IDE to send your report or open the correct repositiory using the information you were provided.
> 
> Similarly, our Marketplace extensions already have their own bug databases, so do not report things here - please see the extension's documentation or its Marketplace page for the exact link you need.

Below we will quickly cover the essentials, but for all the detailed info on all of this bug-reporting process and for information about what we do with your files and your bug reports, please see the [Bugs Overview page](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/wiki/Bugs-Overview) which is part of [this repository's wiki](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/wiki).

## 1. Update GameMaker If Required, Check Your Logs!

If you're not on the current monthly release (at least - remember Betas are available also), then **do not** report something until you have updated GameMaker first and ensured the problem is not fixed already.

**This includes LTS users - please check the current Monthly/Beta first!**

Also, always check your logs for GameMaker to see if they tell you this is a machine setup issue, tools mismatch, or even user-error. [More on how to do this can be found here.](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/wiki/Bugs-Overview#review-gamemakers-log-files)

<br />

## 2. Search The Existing Reports/Requests

Always search the existing issues and ensure your thing is not already submitted, save yourself the time/effort also. [More on how to do this can be found here.](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/wiki/Bugs-Overview#how-do-i-search-for-if-my-problem-has-already-been-reported)

**Responding to duplicates only makes fixing the problem take longer.**

_You can attach a sample package to any existing bug report by using the "Upload a Bug/Ticket Sample" tool on GameMaker's `Help` menu. Copy the link GameMaker gives you after it has uploaded the files to us, then paste the link into a new comment on the bug report._

## 3. If You Need To Send A New Report

When [submitting an issue via this website](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/new/choose), choose the correct form for your problem and then fill in each field with all pertinent information you can provide.

You can also submit bugs directly from the `Help` menu inside GameMaker and it make all of the process very straightforward for you, so in most cases we recommend this route rather than via the forms on this website. [More on how to do this can be found here.](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/wiki/Reporting-Bugs-Via-The-IDE)

**Send all of the requested information, otherwise there will be a delay while we request what's missing.**

Whether you're using the website or the IDE to report your issue, please strongly consider [always sending a *small sample* project](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/wiki/Why-Send-Sample-Projects) if your bug is in-game or when building specific assets in your projects.

**All files you submit via the IDE tools are always private and only viewable by GM staff - you can't even download them yourself.**

## Feature Request Process 

All new GameMaker Feature Requests are regularly reviewed by a multidisciplinary team here at Gamemaker, with all aspects taken into consideration. We curate requests carefully and will evaluate your request in terms of its possibility, difficulty, usability, and value to GameMaker. Once a request has been reviewed it will either be rejected with a reason why or it will be added to the backlog, where anyone can vote on features by leaving a thumbs up or thumbs down. Votes will be periodically reviewed and, when it fits with our schedule, popular and useful features will be added to GameMaker.

_Please note that you may not have advanced notification of your request being worked on, but it will be closed once it has been added to GameMaker._

We thank you for your feedback!
