# GameMaker Bugs & Feature Requests
 
Please do report bugs here for problems you have found inside GameMaker and its manual; however, before submitting anything, it is essential that you carefully read the rest of this page, so that you can be sure the issue is something you need to tell us about and is not reported already.

> [!NOTE]
> if your problem is to do with signing-in or not seeing your correct platforms in Target Manager (even after signing-out and in again), our setup guides, or anything to do with console support, then please continue to contact our customer services team in the usual manner. Similarly, our Marketplace extensions already have their own bug databases, so do not report things here - please see the extension's documentation or its Marketplace page for the exact link you need.*

Here you can also suggest, request, and vote on new features for the GameMaker IDE and Runtime. We value user feedback and strive to make GameMaker the best it can be for developers. By submitting a feature request, you can help us make Gamemaker even better.

<br />

## 1. Update GameMaker first to ensure this isn't fixed already, then review your logs and see our FAQs to confirm it's not a problem with your setup

If you're not on the current monthly release (at least - remember Betas are available also), then do not report something until you have confirmed the current release still shows the problem. This includes LTS users!

Always check your ui.log for GameMaker and your compiler log to see if they tell you this is a machine setup issue. [More info on this on our guide](https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us/articles/13150754375453#h_01HGG0W8C5P8YTKBM7J8C86CFA).

<br />

## 2. Search for any existing report before you send one - do not file a duplicate

Always search [the list of existing issues](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues) and ensure your problem is not already reported, as responding to duplicates only slows us down. You can type your search terms into the query box at the top of the page:

![searching in the Issues list](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/assets/15669932/4a86d410-b432-45fc-8b67-d9aecc6895a0)

If your issue is already reported you are welcome to add a comment/log/sample project onto that existing report - you can also leave a thumbs up to say you have this issue as well.

<br />

## 3. Choose the correct form and fill it all in

When [submitting a bug](https://github.com/YoYoGames/GameMaker-Bugs/issues/new/choose), fill in each field with all pertinent information you can provide.

Send all requested information, otherwise there will be a delay while we request what's missing. Please strongly consider always sending a *small sample* project if your bug is in-game or when building specific assets in your projects.

<br />

## "Report A GameMaker Bug" tool on GameMaker's "Help" menu

You can also [submit issues directly from GameMaker](https://help.gamemaker.io/hc/en-us/articles/13150754375453#h_01HGE35CZ9EJW3NEK24T3TF139) (2023.8/LTS22.03 onwards) and the IDE tools do all of this automatically for you, so in most cases we actually recommend this rather than the forms on this website.

Also, if you just want to send a sample project or logs to attach to any existing bug report (even as a comment on someone else's bug report), then you can use the "Upload a Bug/Ticket Sample" tool. Copy the link GameMaker gives you after it has uploaded the files to us, then paste the link into the GitHub issue.

**All files you submit via the IDE tools are always private and only viewable by GM staff - you can't even download them yourself.**

## Feature Request Process 

All new GameMaker Feature Requests are regularly reviewed by a multidisciplinary team here at Gamemaker, with all aspects taken into consideration.

We curate requests carefully and will evaluate your request in terms of its possibility, difficulty, usability, and value to GameMaker.

Once a request has been reviewed it will either be rejected with a reason why or added to the backlog where anyone can vote on features by leaving a thumbs up or thumbs down.

Votes will be periodically reviewed and, when it fits with our schedule, will be added to GameMaker.

Please note that you may not have advanced notification of your request being worked on but it will be closed once it has been added to GameMaker.


We thank you for your feedback and look forward to hearing your feature requests!
