        For any GameMaker Account or licencing issues (including "I can't see all my platforms in Target Manager") please submit a [Helpdesk Ticket](https://contact.gamemaker.io/contact-us#account) instead of using this form.
        
        Please also ensure you have searched for any existing reports of this issue before you begin - if one exists, please leave a thumbs-up and/or a comment on that one, rather than knowingly filing a duplicate report, as duplicates just slow things down.
       
        Note that most fields are required to be filled-in before you can submit this report, as it is all essential information which we will require in order to confirm and fix your issue.

    attributes:
      label: Description
      description: Write a concise yet detailed description of the issue and do include any relevant screenshots at suitable locations in the body of your text. Please do not type/paste lots of code in this field - attach a sample project instead, as requested below. (Also, do not add a web link as your entire bug report and assume we will read the external thread to work it out ourselves, as we will most likely simply close the report!)
