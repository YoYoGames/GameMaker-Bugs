        Please ensure you have searched for any existing reports of this issue before you begin - if one exists, please leave a thumbs-up and/or a comment on that one, rather than knowingly filing a duplicate report, as duplicates just slow things down.
       
        Note that most fields are required to be filled-in before you can submit this report, as it is all essential information which we will require in order to confirm and fix your issue.

        Be aware that we do not offer coding advice/support on this bug-reporting service and so we are very unlikely to fix any issues with your code and send the project back - if you want to ask a coding question, please ask [the GameMaker Community](https://forum.gamemaker.io/index.php?forums/tech-support.24/) instead of using this form.
